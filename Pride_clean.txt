There is much more difference asto their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “” by convention,because it is felt to be the right andproper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly largeyetunusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably befound partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of thenovels. To some the delightful freshnesshumour of_ NorthangerAbbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubtedcritical facts that its scale is small,its scheme, after all, thatof burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached withdifficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone,not enthrallingin interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisitedelicacykeeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedlytheatrical, the heroheroine are insipid,the author has almostwickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting thatEdmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him,that Fanny mightvery likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;yet the matchless rehearsal-scenesthe characters of Mrs. Norris andothers have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense andSensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it doesnot want them.__I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent voteswould, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the presentbook;perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for MissAusten be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible chargeof vulgarity) would go for_ Emma. _It is the larger, the more varied, themore popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rathermore of the world,had improved her general, though not her mostpeculiarcharacteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as theEltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,I, for my part, declare for_ PridePrejudice _unhesitatingly. Itseems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the mosteminently quintessential of its author’s works;for this contentionin such  space as is permitted to me, I propose here to showcause.__ the book (it may be barely necessary to remind thereader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,when Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised andfinished at Chawton some fifteen years later,was not published till1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in thiscombination of the freshvigorous projection of youth,thecritical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinctsuperiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, itpossesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almostregular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incidentcould be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydiaand Wickham is not, like that of CrawfordMrs. Rushworth, a_ coup dethéâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of thestory earlier,brings about the denouement with complete propriety.All the minor passages--the loves of JaneBingley, the advent of Mr.Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after thesame unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at thehide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions betweenFrank ChurchillJane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to theintrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not thinkthe best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austenalways liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded heropportunities for the display of the peculiarincomparable talent tobe noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectlynatural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct givenby Wickham,by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) fromthe gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positiveaversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand ofthe playwright has ever been laid upon_ PridePrejudice; _and I daresay that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling orgarish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle anddelicate for pitgallery. But if the attempt were made, it wouldcertainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist canavail himself, appear at once on the stage.__I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical tomore than one school of critics, that construction is not the highestmerit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other giftsand graces most advantageously to the critical eye;the want of itwill sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quiteconsciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-builtnovel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or whichdisplayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of allfaculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plotactedtold by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite theability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for oneshould put_ PridePrejudice _far lower if it did not contain whatseem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humourof herfaculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit JohnThorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris,one or two others to their company,but who, in one instance certainly,perhaps in others, are stillsuperior to them.__The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtledelicatethat they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than toexpress,at any particular time likely to be differentlyapprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess agreater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other ofthe numerous species of this great British genus. The differences ofscheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,for there was a distinctly feminine element in “”inJane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that wasmasculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number ofcommon subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,avoidance of loud tonesglaring effects. Also there is in both acertain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with thosewho judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with thesavagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousnessof FieldingSmollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes thather immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very muchprotest. Yet, both in Mr. Addisonin Miss Austen there is, though arestrainedwell-mannered, an insatiableruthless delight inroastingcutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the earlynineteenth;no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunatehusband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gustoall theinnocence in the world, how his wifehis friend induce him to playat blind-man’s-buff. But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damselof fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely,assures her selectedMentor that “”--might have beenwritten by a rather more ladylikeintelligent Lydia Bennet in thedays of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (Ithink unreasonably) have found “” in touches of Miss Austen’sown, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets overher son. But this word “” is one of the most misused in theEnglish language, especially when, by a glaringgratuitousfalsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough andsnarling invective, but to gentleoblique satire. If  meansthe perception of “” the sense of “” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, andthat to seem is not identical with to be--if this be , thenevery manwoman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in afool’s paradise, who has knowledge of naturethe worldlife, isa cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may evenhave been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, shetook an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting atwork her foolsher mean persons. I think she did take this delight,and I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while shewas immensely the better for it as an artist.__In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observedthat “”he has justly added thatwe need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniaturepainter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use theterm miniature in its restricted sense,must think rather of Memlingat one end of the history of paintingMeissonier at the other, thanof Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I shouldmyself use the word “” in connection with her. If her world is amicrocosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as thelittleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called topaint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did notfeel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two veryshort periods of writing--one of about three years,another of notmuch more than five--she executed six capital works,has not left asingle failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in hercomposition was defective: we must always remember that hardlyanybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-centuryseventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scottrequired hillmountainballad, even Coleridge metaphysics andGerman to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was anEnglish girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time whenladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which mightpierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of thegravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct weresubject to all those fantastic limitsrestrictions against whichMary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particulartaste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frosttouched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journeyeven in a black one.__For if her knowledge was not very extended, she k two things whichonly genius knows. The one was humanity,the other was art. On thefirst head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, aretrue,her women are, in the old sense, “” As to art, if shehas never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makesthe false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost anyFrenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant,watch him laboriouslypiling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You getnone; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you canshape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen themyriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.Nothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present bookonly) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “” (and we know_ how _Mrs. Bennet would havestirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray withjustoutspoken admiration.  fantastic as it may seem, Ishould put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put herto Addison in others.__This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appearsnowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.Collins. Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addisonever did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It hasbeen said that no one ever was like him. But in the first place,_ he_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundredsof prime ministersarchbishops, of “” In the second place, it is rash, I think,to conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent atthe end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that wepossess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled firstdraught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. Theformality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portraitis only half alive,is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr.Collins is perfectly natural,perfectly alive. In fact, for all the“” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certainside,more than one, of humanity,especially eighteenth-centuryhumanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,its formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,its selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speechor one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciledwith reality,I should not wonder if many of these wordsactionsare historically true.__But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorilyexhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him thefigures of Mr. Bennetof Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The latter, likeMr. Collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. There is,perhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to mevery faint indeed. Even now I do not think that it would be impossibleto find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noblebirth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,as Lady Catherine. A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the LadyPowerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,rich, long out of marital authority,so forth, had opportunities ofdeveloping these agreeable characteristics which seldom presentthemselves now. As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen,Mr. Darcy,evenMiss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on himfor the “” of his conduct. His wife was evidently,mustalways have been, a quite irreclaimable fool;unless he had shot heror himself there was no way out of it for a man of sensespirit butthe ironic. From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,except for an excusablenot unnatural helplessness at the crisis ofthe elopement,his utterances are the most acutely delightful in theconsciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--thateven Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. It isdifficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,or when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the general sense ofthe world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank hisconsolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “”his inquiryto his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has justrelated as made by himself to  “” These are the things which give Miss Austen’sreaders the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt bythe readers of Swift, of Fielding,we may here add, of Thackeray, asthey are felt by the readers of no other English author of fictionoutside of these four.__The goodness of the minor characters in_ PridePrejudice _has beenalready alluded to,it makes a detailed dwelling on their beautiesdifficult in any space,impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we haveglanced at,it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitelyamusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty andLydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would havedifferentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly andvulgarity of intellectdisposition working upon the commonweaknesses of woman at such different ages. With Mary, Miss Austen hastaken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;not merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interestingtraditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in doomingher privately to marry “” The habits offirst copyingthen retailing moral sentiments, of playing andsinging too long in public, are, no doubt, grievouscriminal; butperhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockingsin that Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate difficult notto extend to her a share of the respectaffection (affection andrespect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr.Collins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall. I sometimes wishthat the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unitethese personages,thus at once achieve a notable matingsoothepoor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail.__The Bingleysthe Gardinersthe Lucases, Miss DarcyMiss deBourgh, Jane, Wickham,the rest, must pass without special comment,further than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa, though is just a little on the thither side of the line betweencomedyfarce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, andthat Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch indealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch indrab of another. Only genius could have made Charlotte what she is, yetnot disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either witha cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But theherothe heroine are not tints to be dismissed.__Darcy has always seemed to me by far the bestmost interesting ofMiss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,whose part is so slightsimple that it hardly enters intocomparison. It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride isunnatural at first in its expressionlater in its yielding, whilehis falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again Icannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own account of the way in whichhis pride had been pampered, is perfectly rationalsufficient; andnothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for itssudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’sscornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing ineven our author is finermore delicately touched than the change ofhis demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had hebeen a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smartingunder his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had comehusband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent with theprobable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not reallyinjured in disposition,thoroughly in love. As for his being inlove, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of thatphenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personalcharm.__The secret of that charm many mennot a few women, from Miss Austenherself downwards, have felt,like most charms it is a thing ratherto be felt than to be explained. Elizabeth of course belongs to the_allegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus. Miss Austen wasalways provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; andexcept the fine eyes,a hint or two that she had at any ratesometimes a bright complexion,was not very tall, we hear nothingabout her looks. But her chief difference from other heroines of thelively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almoststrong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--andsecondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all herpropensity to teasethe sharpness of her tongue. Elizabeth can giveat least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never“”she never attacks first. Some of the merestobsoletenesses of phrasemanner give one or two of her earlyspeeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing,when she comes toserious business, as in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is,as it should be, the climax of the interest of the book),in thefinal ladies’ battle with  she is unexceptionable. Thentoo she is a perfectly natural girl. She does not disguise from herselfor anybody that she resents Darcy’s first ill-mannered personality withas personal a feeling. (By the way, the reproach that the ill-manners ofthis speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the samekind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might havebeen heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from personswho ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.) And she lets theinjury done to Janethe contempt shown to the rest of her familyaggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world.__Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as acommon form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to herplayfulness, her wit, her affectionatenatural disposition, of acertain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her typeage.Nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificentDarcy; nearly all of them would have palpitatedfluttered at theidea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating Wickham.Elizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the“” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “”)women have by educationexperience, a perfect freedom from the ideathat all men may bully her if they choose,that most will away withher if they can. Though not in the least “”she has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. The form ofpassion commonlikely to seem natural in Miss Austen’s day was soinvariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both ofthese qualities, that she has not made Elizabeth outwardly passionate.But I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would havemarried Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, andanybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’conversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have lookedto the Della Cruscans of their own day,perhaps do look to the DellaCruscans of this.__And, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason ofcharm?--it is there. There were better sense in the sad mechanicexercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not. Inthe novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of youngladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are atleast five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of tastespirit canhelp doing so. Their names are, in chronological order, ElizabethBennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond,BarbaraGrant. I should have been most in love with BeatrixArgemone; Ishould, I think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred Dianaand Barbara. But to live withto marry, I do not know that any oneof the four can come into competition with Elizabeth.__GEORGE SAINTSBURY._[Illustration: List of Illustrations.]

But I k I shouldpersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well toneglect such an acquaintance.  how pleased I am!

Lydia, my love, though you _are_the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the nextball.”“” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ theyoungest, .”The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he wouldreturn Mr. Bennet’s visit,determining when they should ask him todinner.[Illustration: “”][Illustration:     “”]CHAPTER III.[Illustration]Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her fivedaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from herhusband any satisfactory description of Mr.  They attacked himin various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, anddistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all;they were atlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had beendelighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremelyagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assemblywith a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond ofdancing was a certain step towards falling in love;very livelyhopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.“”said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “”In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit,sat about tenminutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of beingadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heardmuch; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat morefortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upperwindow, that he wore a blue coatrode a black horse.An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched;already hadMrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to herhousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingleywas obliged to be in town the following day,consequently unable toaccept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quitedisconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in townso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire;she began to fear thathe might always be flying about from one place to another,neversettled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears alittle by starting the idea of his[Illustration:     “”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball;areport soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies andseven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such anumber of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearingthat, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,his five sistersa cousin. And when the party entered theassembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, histwo sisters, the husband of the eldest,another young man.Mr. Bingley was good-lookinggentlemanlike: he had a pleasantcountenance,easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merelylooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attentionof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, andthe report, which was in general circulation within five minutes afterhis entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemenpronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he wasmuch handsomer than Mr. Bingley,he was looked at with greatadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgustwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to beproud, to be above his company,above being pleased;not all hislarge estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,disagreeable countenance,being unworthy to be compared with hisfriend.Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principalpeople in the room: he was livelyunreserved, danced every dance,was angry that the ball closed so early,talked of giving onehimself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak forthemselves. What a contrast between himhis friend! Mr. Darcy dancedonly once with Mrs. Hurstonce with  declined beingintroduced to any other lady,spent the rest of the evening inwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man inthe world,everybody hoped that he would never come there again.Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike ofhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by hishaving slighted one of her daughters.Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sitdown for two dances;during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had beenstanding near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him andMr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press hisfriend to join it.“”“”“”“” cried Bingley, “”“” said Mr.Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.“ she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is oneof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty,Idare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”[Illustration:“”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“”turning round, he looked for a moment atElizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own,coldly said,“: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_;I am in nohumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slightedby other men. You had better return to your partnerenjoy hersmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off;Elizabethremained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfieldparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice,she had beendistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as hermother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’spleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the mostaccomplished girl in the neighbourhood;CatherineLydia had beenfortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that theyhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in goodspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived,of which theywere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With abook, he was regardless of time;on the present occasion he had agood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raisedsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’sviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that hehad a very different story to hear.“ my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “”“” cried her husband impatiently,“”“ my dear,”“”Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against anydescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branchof the subject,related, with much bitterness of spirit,someexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.“”“”[Illustration]CHAPTER IV.[Illustration]When JaneElizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious inher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very muchshe admired him.“”“”“” replied Elizabeth, “”“”“”“”“ you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are goodagreeablein your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”“”“”“”Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour atthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general;with morequickness of observationless pliancy of temper than her sister, andwith a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she wasvery little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fineladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in thepower of being agreeable where they chose it; but proudconceited.They were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first privateseminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in thehabit of spending more than they ought,of associating with peopleof rank;were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well ofthemselvesmeanly of others. They were of a respectable family inthe north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on theirmemories than that their brother’s fortunetheir own had beenacquired by trade.Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundredthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, andsometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with agood housethe liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of thosewho best k the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend theremainder of his days at Netherfield,leave the next generation topurchase.His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; butthough he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by nomeans unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who hadmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to considerhis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been ofage two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, tolook at Netherfield House. He did look at it,into it, for half anhour; was pleased with the situationthe principal rooms, satisfiedwith what the owner said in its praise,took it immediately.Between himDarcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of agreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by theeasiness, openness,ductility of his temper, though no dispositioncould offer a greater contrast to his own,though with his own henever appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingleyhad the firmest reliance,of his judgment the highest opinion. Inunderstanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no meansdeficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,reserved,fastidious;his manners, though well bred, were notinviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingleywas sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continuallygiving offence.The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficientlycharacteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettiergirls in his life; everybody had been most kindattentive to him;there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquaintedwith all the room;as to  he could not conceive an angelmore beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of peoplein whom there was little beautyno fashion, for none of whom he hadfelt the smallest interest,from none received either attention orpleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled toomuch.Mrs. Hursther sister allowed it to be so; but still they admiredherliked her,pronounced her to be a sweet girl,one whomthey should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was thereforeestablished as a sweet girl;their brother felt authorized by suchcommendation to think of her as he chose.[Illustration: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER V.[Illustration]Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennetswere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in tradein Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune,risen to thehonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. Thedistinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him adisgust to his businessto his residence in a small market town;and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house abouta mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where hecould think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled bybusiness, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on thecontrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,friendly,obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made himcourteous.Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be avaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldestof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, wasElizabeth’s intimate friend.That the Miss Lucasesthe Miss Bennets should meet to talk over aball was absolutely necessary;the morning after the assemblybrought the former to Longbourn to hearto communicate.“”with civilself-command, to Miss Lucas. “”“”“ you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To besure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--somethingabout Mr. Robinson.”“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between himMr. Robinson: did notI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Merytonassemblies,whether he did not think there were a great many prettywomen in the room,_which_ he thought the prettiest?hisanswering immediately to the last question, ‘ the eldest beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”“”“” saidCharlotte. “”“”[Illustration: “”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“” said Jane.“”“”“”“”“”“” said Miss Lucas, “”“” said her mother, “”“”“” said Miss Lucas, “”“” replied Elizabeth, “”“” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of herreflections, “”“” cried a young Lucas, who came with hissisters, “”“” said Mrs.Bennet; “”The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that shewould;the argument ended only with the visit.[Illustration][Illustration]CHAPTER VI.[Illustration]The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visitwas returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on thegood-will of Mrs. HurstMiss Bingley;though the mother wasfound to be intolerable,the younger sisters not worth speaking to,a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards thetwo eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatestpleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment ofeverybody, hardly excepting even her sister,could not like them;though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. Itwas generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; andto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preferencewhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first,was in away to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that itwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Janeunited with great strength of feeling, a composure of temperanuniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from thesuspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, MissLucas.“” replied Charlotte, “”“”“”“”“”“” replied Elizabeth, “”“”“”“” said Charlotte, “”“”Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabethwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of someinterest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcelyallowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at theball;when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But nosooner had he made it clear to himselfhis friends that she hadhardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendereduncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. Tothis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he haddetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetryin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light andpleasing;in spite of his asserting that her manners were not thoseof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Ofthis she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who madehimself agreeable nowhere,who had not thought her handsome enoughto dance with.He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversingwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others.

After a songor two,before she could reply to the entreaties of several that shewould sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by hersister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one inthe family, worked hard for knowledgeaccomplishments, was alwaysimpatient for display.Mary had neither genius nor taste;though vanity had given herapplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic airconceitedmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than shehad reached. Elizabeth, easyunaffected, had been listened to withmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well;Mary, at theend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praisegratitude byScotchIrish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who withsome of the Lucases,two or three officers, joined eagerly indancing at one end of the room.Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode ofpassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation,was toomuch engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucaswas his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--“”“”Sir William only smiled. “” hecontinued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “”“”“”“”“”“”“”Mr. Darcy bowed.“”He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed tomake any;Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he wasstruck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing,called out toher,--“”And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, thoughextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantlydrew back,said with some discomposure to Sir William,--“”Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour ofher hand, but in vain.

I k you would be wishing me joy.”“”He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose toentertain herself in this manner;as his composure convinced herthat all was safe, her wit flowed along.[Illustration:     “”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER VII.[Illustration]Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of twothousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,in default of heirs male, on a distant relation;their mother’sfortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supplythe deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, andhad left her four thousand pounds.She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to theirfathersucceeded him in the business,a brother settled inLondon in a respectable line of trade.The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a mostconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually temptedthither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, andto a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,CatherineLydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:their minds were more vacant than their sisters’,when nothingbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morninghoursfurnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare ofs the country in general might be, they always contrived to learnsome from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied bothwith shappiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment inthe neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter,Meryton wasthe head-quarters.Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interestingintelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of theofficers’ namesconnections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philipsvisited them all,this opened to his nieces a source of felicityunknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers;Mr.Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to theirmother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals ofan ensign.After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.Bennet coolly observed,--“”Catherine was disconcerted,made no answer; but Lydia, with perfectindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, andher hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going thenext morning to London.“”“”“”“”“”“ you must not expect such girls to have the sense oftheir fathermother. When they get to our age, I dare say they willnot think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when Iliked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at myheart;if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him;I thoughtColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s inhis regimentals.”“” cried Lydia, “”Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with anote for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield,the servant waitedfor an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure,she waseagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--“ Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Jane, make hastetell us; make haste, my love.”“”and then read it aloud.     /* NIND ““If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa    me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our     lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never     end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of     this. My brotherthe gentlemen are to dine with the officers.

Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before itrained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother wasdelighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;Jane certainly could not come back.“”more thanonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the nextmorning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of hercontrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfieldbrought the following note for Elizabeth:--     /* NIND ““I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will     not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throata     headache, there is not much the matter with me.“”“ my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the notealoud, “”“ I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of littletrifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she staysthere, it is all very well. I would gosee her if I could have thecarriage.”Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though thecarriage was not to be had:as she was no horsewoman, walking washer only alternative. She declared her resolution.“” cried her mother, “”“”“” said her father, “”“”“” observed Mary, “”“” said CatherineLydia.Elizabeth accepted their company,the three young ladies set offtogether.“” said Lydia, as they walked along, “”In Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of oneof the officers’ wives,Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossingfield after field at a quick pace, jumping over stilesspringingover puddles, with impatient activity,finding herself at lastwithin view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings,a faceglowing with the warmth of exercise.She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane wereassembled,where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in suchdirty weather,by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst andMiss Bingley;Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contemptfor it. She was received, however, very politely by them;in theirbrother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there wasgood-humourkindness. Mr. Darcy said very little,Mr. Hurstnothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of thebrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexiondoubt as tothe occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter wasthinking only of his breakfast.Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. MissBennet had slept ill,though up, was very feverish,not wellenough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to herimmediately;Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of givingalarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longedfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,however, to much conversation;when Miss Bingley left them together,could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for theextraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attendedher.When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters;Elizabethbegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection andsolicitude they showed for Jane. ;havingexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught aviolent cold,that they must endeavour to get the better of it;advised her to return to bed,promised her some draughts. The advicewas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased,her headached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor werethe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in factnothing to do elsewhere.When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go,veryunwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,she onlywanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concernat parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offerof the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for thepresent. Elizabeth most thankfully consented,a servant wasdespatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay,bringback a supply of clothes.[Illustration:“”][Illustration:“”]CHAPTER VIII.[Illustration]At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress,at half-past sixElizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which thenpoured in,amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing themuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a veryfavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearingthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, howshocking it was to have a bad cold,how excessively they dislikedbeing ill themselves;then thought no more of the matter:theirindifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restoredElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she couldregard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident,hisattentions to herself most pleasing;they prevented her feelingherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by theothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley wasengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so;as for Mr.Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only toeat, drink,play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plaindish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane,Miss Bingleybegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners werepronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of prideimpertinence:she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurstthought the same,added,--“”“”“”“” said Bingley; “”“” said Miss Bingley; “”“”“”“” said“” observed  in a half whisper,“”“” he replied: “” Ashort pause followed this speech,Mrs. Hurst began again,--“”“”“”“” added her sister;they both laughed heartily.“” cried Bingley, “”“” replied Darcy.To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it theirhearty assent,indulged their mirth for some time at the expense oftheir dear friend’s vulgar relations.With a real of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room onleaving the dining-parlour,sat with her till summoned to coffee.She was still very poorly,Elizabeth would not quit her at all, tilllate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, andwhen it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should godown stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the wholeparty at loo,was immediately invited to join them; but suspectingthem to be playing high, she declined it,making her sister theexcuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could staybelow, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.“” said he; “”“” said  “”“”“”“” said Bingley; “”Elizabeth thanked him from her heart,then walked towards a tablewhere a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch herothers; all that his library afforded.“”Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with thosein the room.“” said  “”“” he replied: “”“”“”“”“”“”“”“”“”Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very littleattention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew nearthe card-table,stationed herself between Mr. Bingleyhis eldestsister, to observe the game.“” said Miss Bingley: “”“”“”“” said Bingley, “”“”“”“” said Darcy, “hastoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it nootherwise than by netting a purse or ; but I am veryfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.

As allconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left theroom.“” said  when the door was closed on her, “”“” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,“”Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as tocontinue the subject.Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, andthat she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent forimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice couldbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the mosteminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not sounwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal;it was settledthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennetwere not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sistersdeclared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief tohis feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that everypossible attention might be paid to the sick ladyher sister.[Illustration:M^{rs} Bennether two youngest girls[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER IX.[Illustration]Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room,in themorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to theinquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on hissisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have anote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane,form herown judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, andits contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by hertwo youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have beenvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness wasnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as herrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. Shewould not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carriedhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, thinkit at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on MissBingley’s appearanceinvitation, the motherthree daughters allattended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopesthat Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.“” was her answer. “”“” cried  “”“” said  with cold civility,“”Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.“”“”“” replied he; “”“” said Elizabeth.“”turning towards her.“”“”“”“” cried her mother, “”“” continued Bingley, immediately, “”“”“” said Darcy, “”“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something  to beobserved in them for ever.”“” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning acountry neighbourhood. “”Everybody was surprised;Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a completevictory over him, continued her triumph,--“”“”“”“” looking at Darcy, “”“”blushing for hermother. “”“”Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep hiscountenance. His sister was less delicate,directed her eye towardsMr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake ofsaying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her ifCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.“”“”“”“” said “”“”impatiently. “”“” said Darcy.“”Darcy only smiled;the general pause which ensued made Elizabethtremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed tospeak, but could think of nothing to say;after a short silence Mrs.Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness toJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley wasunaffectedly civil in his answer,forced his younger sister to becivil also,say what the occasion required. She performed her part,indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, andsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest ofher daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering toeach other during the whole visit;the result of it was, that theyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first cominginto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexionand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whoseaffection had brought her into public at an early age. She had highanimal spirits,a sort of natural self-consequence, which theattentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinnersherown easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She wasvery equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of theball,abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would bethe most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answerto this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.“”Lydia declared herself satisfied. “” sheadded, “”Mrs. Bennether daughters then departed,Elizabeth returnedinstantly to Jane, leaving her ownher relations’ behaviour to theremarks of the two ladiesMr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite ofall Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.[Illustration]CHAPTER X.[Illustration]The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. HurstMissBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, whocontinued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joinedtheir party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.Mr. Darcy was writing, seated near him, was watchingthe progress of his letter,repeatedly calling off his attention bymessages to his sister. Mr. HurstMr. Bingley were at piquet, andMrs. Hurst was observing their game.Elizabeth took up some needlework,was sufficiently amused inattending to what passed between Darcyhis companion. The perpetualcommendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evennessof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcernwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue,wasexactly in unison with her opinion of each.“”He made no answer.“”“”“”“”“”“”“”“”“”He was silent.“”“”“ it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do youalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”“”“”“” cried herbrother, “”“”“” cried  “”“”“”“”“” said Darcy, “”“”“”“” cried Bingley, “”“”“”“”“” said Bingley, “”“”“”“”“”“”“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence offriendshipaffection. A regard for the requester would often makeone readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reasonone into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you havesupposed about Mr.  We may as well wait, perhaps, till thecircumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviourthereupon. But in generalordinary cases, between friendfriend,where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of novery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complyingwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”“”“” cried Bingley; “”Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he wasrather offended,therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmlyresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with herbrother for talking such nonsense.“” said his friend. “”“”“”“”Mr. Darcy took her advice,did finish his letter.When that business was over, he applied to Miss BingleyElizabethfor the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity tothe pianoforte,after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead theway, which the other as politelymore earnestly negatived, sheseated herself.Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister;while they were thus employed,Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-booksthat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixedon her. She hardly k how to suppose that she could be an object ofadmiration to so great a man,yet that he should look at her becausehe disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about hermore wrongreprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than inany other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She likedhim too little to care for his approbation.After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by alively Scotch air;soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing nearElizabeth, said to her,--“”She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with somesurprise at her silence.“”“”“”Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at hisgallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetnessarchness in hermanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody,Darcy hadnever been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He reallybelieved that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, heshould be in some danger.Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous;her greatanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received someassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking oftheir supposed marriage,planning his happiness in such an alliance.“”as they were walking together in the shrubbery thenext day, “”[Illustration:     “”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“”“”“”At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst andElizabeth herself.“” said  in someconfusion, lest they had been overheard.“” answered Mrs. Hurst, “”Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walkby herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,and immediately said,--“”But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,laughingly answered,--“. You are charmingly grouped,appear touncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting afourth. Good-bye.”She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope ofbeing at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recoveredas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.[Illustration:     “”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER XI.[Illustration]When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister, andseeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions ofpleasure;Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they wereduring the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powersof conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainmentwith accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour,laugh at theiracquaintance with spirit.But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy,she hadsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressedhimself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurstalso made her a slight bow,said he was “” but diffusenessand warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy andattention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest sheshould suffer from the change of room;she removed, at his desire,to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from thedoor. He then sat down by her,talked scarcely to anyone else.Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with greatdelight.When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of thecard-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.Darcy did not wish for cards,Mr. Hurst soon found even his openpetition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play,thesilence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.Hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of thesofasgo to sleep. Darcy took up a book. Miss Bingley did the same;and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets andrings, joined nowthen in her brother’s conversation with MissBennet.Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own;she wasperpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. Shecould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered herquestionread on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to beamused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was thesecond volume of his, she gave a great yawnsaid, “”No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, andcast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearingher brother mentioning a ball to  she turned suddenlytowards himsaid,--“”“” cried her brother, “”“”“”“”Miss Bingley made no answer,soon afterwards got upwalked aboutthe room. Her figure was elegant,she walked well; but Darcy, atwhom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In thedesperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,turning to Elizabeth, said,--“ let me persuade you to follow my example,take aturn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting solong in one attitude.”Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingleysucceeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy lookedup. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter asElizabeth herself could be,unconsciously closed his book. He wasdirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing thathe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk updownthe room together, with either of which motives his joining them wouldinterfere. What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be hismeaning--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.“” was her answer; “” however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy inanything,persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of histwo motives.“”as soonas she allowed him to speak. “”“ shocking!” cried Miss  “”“” said Elizabeth. “”“”“”“”“”“”“” replied Elizabeth, “”“”“”“”Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.“” said Miss Bingley;“”“”“” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,but they are not,  of understanding. My temper I dare not vouchfor. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for theconvenience of the world. I cannot forget the folliesvices ofothers so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. Myfeelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temperwould perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost forever.”“”“”“”“”“”with a smile, “”“” cried  tired of aconversation in which she had no share. “”Her sister made not the smallest objection,the pianoforte wasopened;Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry forit. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.[Illustration]CHAPTER XII.[Illustration]In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote thenext morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent forthem in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated onher daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, whichwould exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receivethem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, atleast not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriagebefore Tuesday;in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingleyand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them verywell. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positivelyresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked;fearful, on thecontrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately,atlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfieldthat morning should be mentioned,the request made.The communication excited many professions of concern;enough wassaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work onJane;till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley wasthen sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousydislikeof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go sosoon,repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not besafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm whereshe felt herself to be right.To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been atNetherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked;MissBingley was uncivil to _her_more teasing than usual to himself. Hewisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admirationshould _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope ofinfluencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had beensuggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weightin confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoketen words to her through the whole of Saturday:though they were atone time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered mostconscientiously to his book,would not even look at her.On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almostall, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at lastvery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane;when they parted,after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her tosee her either at Longbourn or Netherfield,embracing her mosttenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave ofthe whole party in the liveliest spirits.They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennetwondered at their coming,thought them very wrong to give so muchtrouble,was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But theirfather, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was reallyglad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. Theevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of itsanimation,almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane andElizabeth.They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough basshumannature;had some  extracts to admiresome  observations ofthreadbare morality to listen to. CatherineLydia had informationfor them of a different sort. Much had been done,much had been saidin the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officershad dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged;ithad actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.[Illustration]CHAPTER XIII[Illustration]“ my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were atbreakfast the next morning, “”“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in;I hope _my_ dinnersare good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”“”Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentlemana stranger! It is Mr.Bingley, I am sure. Why, Jane--you never dropped a word of this--you slything!  I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. But--good Lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be gotto-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill thismoment.”“” said her husband; “”This roused a general astonishment;he had the pleasure of beingeagerly questioned by his wifefive daughters at once.After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thusexplained:--“”“ my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thingin the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your ownchildren; if I had been you, I should have tried long agoto do something or other about it.”JaneElizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.They had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs.Bennet was beyond the reach of reason;she continued to railbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family offive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.“”“”“ that I am sure I shall not:I think it was very impertinent ofhim to write to you at all,very hypocritical. I hate such falsefriends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his fatherdid before him?”“”     /* RIGHT ““Dear Sir,     “”--‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’--““WILLIAM COLLINS.”“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”“He seems to be a mostconscientiouspolite young man, upon my word; and, I doubt not, willprove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be soindulgent as to let him come to us again.”“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, ifhe is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person todiscourage him.”“Though it is difficult,”“to guess in what way he can meanto make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to hiscredit.”Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for LadyCatherine,his kind intention of christening, marrying,buryinghis parishioners whenever it were required.“He must be an oddity, I think,”“I cannot make him out. Thereis something very pompous in his style. And what can he mean byapologizing for being next in the entail? We cannot suppose he wouldhelp it, if he could. Can he be a sensible man, sir?”“ my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite thereverse. There is a mixture of servilityself-importance in hisletter which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”“In point of composition,”“his letter does not seemdefective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly , yet Ithink it is well expressed.”To CatherineLydia neither the letter nor its writer were in anydegree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin shouldcome in a scarlet coat,it was now some weeks since they hadreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As fortheir mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure whichastonished her husbanddaughters.Mr. Collins was punctual to his time,was received with greatpoliteness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but theladies were ready enough to talk,Mr. Collins seemed neither in needof encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave andstately,his manners were very formal. He had not been long seatedbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family ofdaughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in thisinstance, fame had fallen short of the truth;added, that he did notdoubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. Thisgallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,--“You are very kind, sir, I am sure;I wish with all my heart it mayprove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled sooddly.”“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”“Ah, sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, youmust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,I know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estateswill go when once they come to be entailed.”“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, andcould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearingforwardprecipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I comeprepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but, perhaps,when we are better acquainted----”He was interrupted by a summons to dinner;the girls smiled on eachother. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. Thehall, the dining-room,all its furniture, were examinedpraised;and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’sheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as hisown future property. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of itscookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assuredhim, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a goodcook,that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He beggedpardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declaredherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about aquarter of an hour.[Illustration]CHAPTER XIV[Illustration]During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servantswere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with hisguest,therefore started a subject in which he expected him toshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. LadyCatherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes,consideration for hiscomfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosenbetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated himto more than usual solemnity of manner;with a most important aspecthe protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in aperson of rank--such affabilitycondescension, as he had himselfexperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased toapprove of both the discourses which he had already had the honour ofpreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool ofquadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by manypeople, he k, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; shemade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of theneighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week ortwo to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him tomarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion;hadonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectlyapproved all the alterations he had been making,had even vouchsafedto suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.“That is all very propercivil, ”“and Idare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladiesin general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lanefrom Rosings Park, her Ladyship’s residence.”“I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?”“She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings,of veryextensive property.”“Ah,”“then she is better off thanmany girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”“She is a most charming young lady, indeed. Lady Catherine herself saysthat, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to thehandsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marksthe young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sicklyconstitution, which has prevented her making that progress in manyaccomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I aminformed by the lady who superintended her education,who stillresides with them. But she is perfectly amiable,often condescendsto drive by my humble abode in her little phaetonponies.”“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies atcourt.”“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprivedthe British Court of its brightest ornament. Her Ladyship seemed pleasedwith the idea;you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion tooffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable toladies. I have more than once observed to  that hercharming daughter seemed born to be a duchess;that the mostelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned byher. These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, andit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound topay.”“You judge very properly,”“and it is happy for youthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I askwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of themoment, or are the result of previous study?”“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time;though Isometimes amuse myself with suggestingarranging such little elegantcompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish togive them as unstudied an air as possible.”Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurdas he had hoped;he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partnerin his pleasure.By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough,Mr. Bennet was gladto take his guest into the drawing-room again,when tea was over,glad to invite him[Illustration:“Protestedthat he never read novels”      H.T Feb 94]to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented,a bookwas produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to befrom a circulating library) he started back, and, begging pardon,protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him,Lydiaexclaimed. Other books were produced,after some deliberation hechose “Fordyce’s Sermons.” Lydia gaped as he opened the volume; andbefore he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, sheinterrupted him with,--“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Philips talks of turning awayRichard?if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told meso herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear moreabout it,to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.Collins, much offended, laid aside his book,said,--“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by booksof a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazesme, I confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous tothem as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.” turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist atbackgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he actedvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.Bennether daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia’sinterruption,promised that it should not occur again, if he wouldresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore hisyoung cousin no ill-will,should never resent her behaviour as anyaffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet,preparedfor backgammon.[Illustration]CHAPTER XV.[Illustration]Mr. Collins was not a sensible man,the deficiency of nature hadbeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part ofhis life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate andmiserly father;though he belonged to one of the universities, hehad merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any usefulacquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up hadgiven him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a gooddeal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living inretirement,the consequential feelings of earlyunexpectedprosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine deBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant;the respect which hefelt for her high rank,his veneration for her as his patroness,mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as aclergyman,his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture ofprideobsequiousness, self-importancehumility.Having now a good housea very sufficient income, he intended tomarry;in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he hada wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he foundthem as handsomeamiable as they were represented by common report.This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’sestate;he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility andsuitableness,excessively generousdisinterested on his ownpart.His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely faceconfirmed his views,established all his strictest notions of whatwas due to seniority;for the first evening _she_ was his settledchoice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarterof an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, aconversation beginning with his parsonage-house,leading naturallyto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found atLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smilesgeneralencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As toher _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she couldnot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her_eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her tohint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soondone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equallynext to Jane in birthbeauty, succeeded her of course.Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint,trusted that she might soon havetwo daughters married;the man whom she could not bear to speak ofthe day before, was now high in her good graces.Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sisterexcept Mary agreed to go with her;Mr. Collins was to attend them,at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followedhim after breakfast,there he would continue, nominally engaged withone of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.Bennet, with little cessation, of his housegarden at Hunsford. Suchdoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had beenalways sure of leisuretranquillity;though prepared, as he toldElizabeth, to meet with follyconceit in every other room in thehouse, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in theirwalk;Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walkerthan a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, andgo.In pompous nothings on his side,civil assents on that of hiscousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention ofthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyeswere immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, andnothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really  muslin ina shop window, could recall them.But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whomthey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walkingwith an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the veryMr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, andhe bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, allwondered who he could be;KittyLydia, determined if possibleto find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wantingsomething in an opposite shop,fortunately had just gained thepavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the samespot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly,entreated permission tointroduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the daybefore from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission intheir corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wantedonly regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance wasgreatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a finecountenance, a good figure,very pleasing address. The introductionwas followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--areadiness at the same time perfectly correctunassuming;thewhole party were still standingtalking together very agreeably,when the sound of horses drew their notice,DarcyBingley wereseen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the groupthe two gentlemen came directly towards them,began the usualcivilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman,Miss Bennet theprincipal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn onpurpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, andwas beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when theywere suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger;Elizabethhappening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it wasimpossible not to long to know.In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed whatpassed, took leaverode on with his friend.Mr. DennyMr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door ofMr. Philips’s house,then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’spressing entreaties that they would come in,even in spite of Mrs.Philips’s throwing up the parlour window,loudly seconding theinvitation.Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces;the two eldest, fromtheir recent absence, were particularly welcome;she was eagerlyexpressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their owncarriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, ifshe had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who hadtold her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimedtowards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him withher very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance withher, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might bejustified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him toher notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of goodbreeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end toby exclamationsinquiries about the other, of whom, however, shecould only tell her nieces what they already k, that Mr. Denny hadbrought him from London,that he was to have a lieutenant’scommission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,she said, as he walked updown the street,--and had Mr. Wickhamappeared, KittyLydia would certainly have continued the occupation;but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of theofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses thenext day,their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.Wickham,give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbournwould come in the evening. This was agreed to;Mrs. Philipsprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lotterytickets,a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of suchdelights was very cheering,they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room,was assured,with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen passbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either orboth, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain suchbehaviour than her sister.Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.Philips’s mannerspoliteness. He protested that, except LadyCatherineher daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; forshe had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had evenpointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, althoughutterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might beattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with somuch attention in the whole course of his life.[Illustration]CHAPTER XVI.[Illustration]As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with theiraunt,all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr.Mrs. Bennet fora single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coachconveyed himhis five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton;thegirls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation,was then inthe house.When this information was given,they had all taken their seats, Mr.Collins was at leisure to look around himadmire,he was so muchstruck with the sizefurniture of the apartment, that he declared hemight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlourat Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey muchgratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosingswas,who was its proprietor, when she had listened to thedescription of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms,foundthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt allthe force of the compliment,would hardly have resented a comparisonwith the housekeeper’s room.In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherineher mansion,with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode,theimprovements it was receiving, he was happily employed until thegentlemen joined them;he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentivelistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what sheheard,who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours assoon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument,examinetheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, theinterval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.The gentlemen did approach:when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinkingof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. Theofficers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,gentlemanlike setthe best of them were of the present party; butMr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, andwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.[Illustration:“”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye wasturned,Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seatedhimself;the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell intoconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night,on theprobability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by theskill of the speaker.With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickhamtheofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the youngladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kindlistener in Mrs. Philips,was, by her watchfulness, most abundantlysupplied with coffeemuffin.When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,in return, by sitting down to whist.“I know little of the game at present,”“but I shall be glad toimprove myself; for in my situation of life----” Mrs. Philips was verythankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.Mr. Wickham did not play at whist,with ready delight was hereceived at the other table between ElizabethLydia. At first thereseemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a mostdetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making betsand exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was thereforeat leisure to talk to Elizabeth,she was very willing to hear him,though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not evenmention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedlyrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how farNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked ina hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.“About a month,”“he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, Iunderstand.”“”“his estate there is a noble one. A clear tenthousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable ofgiving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have beenconnected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”Elizabeth could not but look surprised.“You may well be surprised,  at such an assertion, afterseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meetingyesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”“As much as I ever wish to be,”“I have spentfour days in the same house with him,I think him verydisagreeable.”“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,”“as to his beingagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known himtoo longtoo well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ tobe impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in generalastonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so stronglyanywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”“Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in theneighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked inHertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not findhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.”“I cannot pretend to be sorry,”after a shortinterruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyondtheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. Theworld is blinded by his fortuneconsequence, or frightened by hishighimposing manners,sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be anill-tempered man.”Wickham only shook his head.“I wonder,”at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he islikely to be in this country much longer.”“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when Iwas at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire willnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”“Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. We are not on friendly terms,and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason foravoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense ofvery great ill-usage,most painful regrets at his being what he is.His father,  the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best menthat ever breathed,the truest friend I ever had;I can never bein company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by athousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has beenscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything andeverything, rather than his disappointing the hopesdisgracing thememory of his father.”Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase,listened withall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, theneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that hehad yet seen,speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle butvery intelligible gallantry.“It was the prospect of constant society,good society,”“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be amost respectable, agreeable corps;my friend Denny tempted mefurther by his account of their present quarters,the very greatattentionsexcellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, andmy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employmentsociety.A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances havenow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--Iwas brought up for the church;I should at this time have been inpossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman wewere speaking of just now.”“”“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the bestliving in his gift. He was my godfather,excessively attached to me.I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was givenelsewhere.”“Good heavens!”“but how could _that_ be? How could hiswill be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as togive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted theintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merelyconditional recommendation,to assert that I had forfeited all claimto it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as Iwas of an age to hold it,that it was given to another man;noless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really doneanything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper,Imay perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him,_to_ him, toofreely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are verydifferent sort of men,that he hates me.”“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till Ican forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings,thought him handsomer thanever as he expressed them.“But what,”“can have been his motive? what canhave induced him to behave so cruelly?”“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot butattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked meless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommonattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He hadnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sortof preference which was often given me.”“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never likedhim, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to bedespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him ofdescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity asthis!”After a few minutes’ reflection, however,“I _do_remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability ofhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His dispositionmust be dreadful.”“I will not trust myself on the subject,”“_I_ canhardly be just to him.”Elizabeth was again deep in thought,after a time exclaimed, “Totreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of hisfather!”“A young man, too, like _you_, whose verycountenance may vouch for your being amiable.”“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion fromchildhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closestmanner.”“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatestpart of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of useto the late Mr. Darcy,devoted all his time to the care of thePemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a mostintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself tobe under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him avoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt itto be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”“How strange!”“How abominable! I wonder that the verypride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you. If from no bettermotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--fordishonesty I must call it.”“It _is_ wonderful,”“for almost all his actions may betraced to pride;pride has often been his best friend. It hasconnected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are noneof us consistent;in his behaviour to me there were strongerimpulses even than pride.”“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”“Yes; it has often led him to be liberalgenerous; to give his moneyfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants,relieve thepoor. Family pride,_filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what hisfather was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, todegenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of thePemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind andcareful guardian of his sister;you will hear him generally cried upas the most attentivebest of brothers.”“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain tospeak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, veryproud. As a child, she was affectionatepleasing,extremely fondof me;I have devoted hourshours to her amusement. But she isnothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death herhome has been London, where a lady lives with her,superintends hereducation.”After many pausesmany trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could nothelp reverting once more to the first,saying,--“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr.  How can Mr. Bingley,who seems good-humour itself,is, I really believe, truly amiable,be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do youknow Mr. Bingley?”“Not at all.”“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.Darcy is.”“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does notwant abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worthhis while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is avery different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pridenever deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowingsomething for fortunefigure.”The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered roundthe other table,Mr. Collins took his station between his cousinElizabethMrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success weremade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assuredher, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;that he considered the money as a mere trifle,begged she would notmake herself uneasy.“I know very well, madam,”“that when persons sit down to acard table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily Iam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. Thereare, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to LadyCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regardinglittle matters.”Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught;after observing Mr. Collins fora few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relationswere very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,”“has very lately given him aliving. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to hernotice, but he certainly has not known her long.”“You know of course that Lady Catherine de BourghLady Anne Darcywere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”“ indeed, I did not. I k nothing at all of Lady Catherine’sconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day beforeyesterday.”“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,it isbelieved that sheher cousin will unite the two estates.”This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vainuseless heraffection for his sisterher praise of himself, if he were alreadyself-destined to another.“Mr. Collins,”“speaks highly both of Lady Catherineherdaughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of herLadyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him;that, in spite ofher being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”“I believe her to be both in a great degree,”“I havenot seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never likedher,that her manners were dictatorialinsolent. She has thereputation of being remarkably sensibleclever; but I rather believeshe derives part of her abilities from her rankfortune, part fromher authoritative manner,the rest from the pride of her nephew, whochooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding ofthe first class.”Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, andthey continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper putan end to cards,gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.Wickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise ofMrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him toeverybody. Whatever he said, was said well;whatever he did, donegracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She couldthink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham,of what he had told her, allthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name asthey went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydiatalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lostthefish she had won;Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. andMrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his lossesat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper,repeatedly fearingthat he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well managebefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.[Illustration:     “delighted to see their dear friend again”]CHAPTER XVII.[Illustration]Elizabeth related to Jane, the next day, what had passed between Mr.Wickhamherself. Jane listened with astonishmentconcern: shek not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.Bingley’s regard;yet it was not in her nature to question theveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. Thepossibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough tointerest all her tender feelings;nothing therefore remained to bedone but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, andthrow into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not beotherwise explained.“They have both,”“been deceived, I dare say, in some way orother, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhapsmisrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us toconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,without actual blame on either side.”“Very true, indeed;now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say inbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in thebusiness? Do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill ofsomebody.”“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of myopinion. My dearest  do but consider in what a disgraceful lightit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such amanner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. It isimpossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for hischaracter, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be soexcessively deceived in him? Oh no.”“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than thatMr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me lastnight; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be notso, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”“It is difficult, indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what tothink.”“I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer whenthe affair became public.The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where thisconversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whomthey had been speaking; Mr. Bingleyhis sisters came to give theirpersonal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which wasfixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to seetheir dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, andrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since theirseparation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising fromtheir seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, andhurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to everyfemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given incompliment to her eldest daughter,was particularly flattered byreceiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of aceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in thesociety of her two friends,the attentions of their brother; andElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.Wickham,of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s lookand behaviour. The happiness anticipated by CatherineLydia dependedless on any single event, or any particular person; for though theyeach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them,a ballwas, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that shehad no disinclination for it.“While I can have my mornings to myself,”“it is enough. Ithink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.Society has claims on us all;I profess myself one of those whoconsider intervals of recreationamusement as desirable foreverybody.”Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she didnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help askinghim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation,if hedid, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’samusement;she was rather surprised to find that he entertained noscruple whatever on that head,was very far from dreading a rebuke,either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing todance.“I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,”“that a ball ofthis kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, canhave any evil tendency;I am so far from objecting to dancingmyself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my faircousins in the course of the evening;I take this opportunity ofsoliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; apreference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the rightcause,not to any disrespect for her.”Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed beingengaged by Wickham for those very dances;to have Mr. Collinsinstead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no helpfor it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happinessher own was perforcedelayed a little longer,Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with asgood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with hisgallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. It now firststruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy ofbeing the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage,of assisting to form aquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasingcivilities towards herself,heard his frequent attempt at acompliment on her witvivacity;though more astonished thangratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long beforeher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriagewas exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not chooseto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be theconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare fortalk of, theyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;for, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there wassuch a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. Noaunt, no officers, no s could be sought after; the very shoe-rosesfor Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found sometrial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvementof her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham;nothing less than a dance onTuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday,Mondayendurable to KittyLydia.[Illustration]CHAPTER XVIII.[Illustration]Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield,looked invain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, adoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty ofmeeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections thatmight not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more thanusual care,prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of allthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more thanmight be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose thedreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’spleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers;though thiswas not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence waspronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, andwho told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on businessthe day before,was not yet returned; adding, with a significantsmile,--“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, ifhe had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught byElizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable forWickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feelingof displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediatedisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility tothe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. Shewas resolved against any sort of conversation with him,turned awaywith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even inspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour;though every prospectof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on herspirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom shehad not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntarytransition to the oddities of her cousin,to point him out to herparticular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return ofdistress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward andsolemn, apologizing instead of attending,often moving wrongwithout being aware of it, gave her all the shamemisery which adisagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of herrelease from him was ecstasy.She danced next with an officer,had the refreshment of talking ofWickham,of hearing that he was universally liked. When those danceswere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas,was in conversation withher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who tookher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, withoutknowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away againimmediately,she was left to fret over her own want of presence ofmind: Charlotte tried to console her.“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To finda man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such anevil.”When the dancing recommenced, however,Darcy approached to claim herhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be asimpleton,allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasantin the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made noanswer,took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to whichshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, andreading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.They stood for some time without speaking a word;she began toimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, atfirst, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that itwould be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied,was againsilent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,with--“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about thedance,_you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of theroom, or the number of couples.”He smiled,assured her that whatever she wished him to say should besaid.“Very well; that reply will do for the present.  by-and-by, Imay observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but_now_ we may be silent.”“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to beentirely silent for half an hour together;yet, for the advantage of_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have thetrouble of saying as little as possible.”“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do youimagine that you are gratifying mine?”“Both,”“for I have always seen a greatsimilarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to saysomething that will amaze the whole room,be handed down toposterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, ”“How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”“I must not decide on my own performance.”He made no answer;they were again silent till they had gone downthe dance, when he asked her if sheher sisters did not very oftenwalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resistthe temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had justbeen forming a  acquaintance.”The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread hisfeatures, but he said not a word;Elizabeth, though blaming herselffor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke,in aconstrained manner said,--“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,is less certain.”“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,”“and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from allhis life.”Darcy made no answer,seemed desirous of changing the subject. Atthat moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to passthrough the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.Darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him onhis dancinghis partner.“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such verysuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to thefirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does notdisgrace you:that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancingat her sisterBingley), shall take place. What congratulations willthen flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse ofthat young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”[Illustration:“Such very superior dancing is notoften seen.”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but SirWilliam’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly,hiseyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley andJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,he turned to his partner,said,--“Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talkingof.”“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not haveinterrupted any two people in the room who had less to say forthemselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success,and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”“What think you of books?”smiling.“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the samefeelings.”“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least beno want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full ofsomething else.”“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,with a look of doubt.“ always,”without knowing what she said; for herthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appearedby her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, wasunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _beingcreated_?”“I am,”with a firm voice.“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”“I hope not.”“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,to be secure of judging properly at first.”“May I ask to what these questions tend?”“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,”endeavouringto shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”“And what is your success?”She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such differentaccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”“I can readily believe,”“that reports may varygreatly with respect to me;I could wish,  that you werenot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason tofear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have anotheropportunity.”“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.She said no more,they went down the other danceparted insilence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; forin Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,which soon procured her pardon,directed all his anger againstanother.They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?Your sister has been talking to me about him,asking me a thousandquestions;I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among hisother communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.Darcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to giveimplicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s usinghim ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been alwaysremarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in amost infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know verywell that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bearto hear George Wickham mentioned;that though my brother thought hecould not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, hewas excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, andI wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for thisdiscovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering hisdescent, one could not expect much better.”“His guilthis descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”“for I have heard you accuse him of nothingworse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward,of _that_, I canassure you, he informed me himself.”“I beg your pardon,” replied  turning away with a sneer.“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”“Insolent girl!”“You are much mistaken ifyou expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I seenothing in it but your own wilful ignorancethe malice of Mr.Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to makeinquiries on the same subject of  Jane met her with a smile ofsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficientlymarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.Elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitudefor Wickham, resentment against his enemies,everything else, gaveway before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.“I want to know,”with a countenance no less smiling than hersister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you havebeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which caseyou may be sure of my pardon.”“”“I have not forgotten him; but I have nothingsatisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of hishistory,is quite ignorant of the circumstances which haveprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,the probityhonour, of his friend,is perfectly convinced thatMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he hasreceived;I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as hissister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I amafraid he has been very imprudent,has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’sregard.”“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I amperfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heardthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left tohim _conditionally_ only.”“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,”“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.Bingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; butsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story,has learntthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think ofboth gentlemen as I did before.”She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,onwhich there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened withdelight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained ofBingley’s regard,said all in her power to heighten her confidencein it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrewto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her lastpartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunateas to make a most important discovery.“I have found out,”“by a singular accident, that there is nowin the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear thegentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours ofthis house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh,of her mother,Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who wouldhave thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine deBourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is madein time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My totalignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power toassure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring himthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction asan impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that itwas not in the least necessary there should be any notice on eitherside,that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior inconsequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her withthe determined air of following his own inclination,when she ceasedspeaking, replied thus,--“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of yourexcellent judgment in all matters within the scope of yourunderstanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide differencebetween the established forms of ceremony amongst the laitythosewhich regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I considerthe clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rankin the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at thesame time maintained. You must, therefore, allow me to follow thedictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to performwhat I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit byyour advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by educationand habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady likeyourself;”“apology,”“Hunsford,”“Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see himexpose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him withunrestrained wonder;when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was notdiscouraged from speaking again,Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemedabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech;at theend of it he only made him a slight bow,moved another way: Mr.Collins then returned to Elizabeth.“I have no reason, I assure you,”“to be dissatisfied with myreception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answeredme with the utmost civility,even paid me the compliment of saying,that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to becertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a veryhandsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turnedher attention almost entirely on her sisterMr. Bingley;thetrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to madeher perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in thatvery house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection couldbestow;she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouringeven to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainlysaw were bent the same way,she determined not to venture near her,lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them withinone of each other;deeply was she vexed to find that her mother wastalking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly,of nothingelse but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. It was an animating subject,Mrs. Bennet seemed incapableof fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being sucha charming young man,so rich,living but three miles from them,were the first points of self-gratulation;then it was such acomfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane,to becertain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. Itwas, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, asJane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able toconsign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she mightnot be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessaryto make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on suchoccasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. Sheconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equallyfortunate, though evidentlytriumphantly believing there was nochance of it.In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’swords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audiblewhisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that thechief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Hermother only scolded her for being nonsensical.“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I amsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to saynothing _he_ may not like to hear.”“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be to youto offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend byso doing.”Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother wouldtalk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed andblushed again with shamevexation. She could not help frequentlyglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of whatshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she wasconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expressionof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed andsteady gravity.At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say;Lady Lucas, whohad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw nolikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold hamchicken.Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval oftranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of,shehad the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,preparing to oblige the company. By many significant lookssilententreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof ofcomplaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such anopportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her,she began her song.Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; andshe watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatiencewhich was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receivingamongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might beprevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minutebegan another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;her voice was weak,her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedlytalking to  She looked at his two sisters,saw them makingsigns of derision at each other,at Darcy, who continued, however,impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat hisinterference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--“That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; andElizabeth, sorry for her,sorry for her father’s speech, was afraidher anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.“If I,”“were so fortunate as to be able to sing, Ishould have great pleasure,  in obliging the company with anair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion,perfectlycompatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time tomusic, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. Therector of a parish has much to do.  he must make suchan agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himselfnotoffensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons;the timethat remains will not be too much for his parish duties,the careand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from makingas comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importancethat he should have attentiveconciliatory manners towardseverybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. Icannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man whoshould omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybodyconnected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concludedhis speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half theroom. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins forhaving spoken so sensibly,observed, in a half-whisper to LadyLucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement toexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it wouldhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, orfiner success;happy did she think it for Bingleyher sisterthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice,that hisfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which hemust have witnessed. That his two sistersMr. Darcy, however, shouldhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; andshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, orthe insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased byMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side;though hecould not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of herpower to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up withsomebody else,offered to introduce him to any young lady in theroom. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferentto it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommendhimself to her;that he should therefore make a point of remainingclose to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such aproject. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, whooften joined them,good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversationto herself.She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:though often standing within a very short distance of her, quitedisengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be theprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham,rejoiced init.The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart;by amanœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of anhour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see howheartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hursthersister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, andwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsedevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw alanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the longspeeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingleyhissisters on the elegance of their entertainment,the hospitality andpoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy saidnothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.Mr. BingleyJane were standing together a little detached from therest,talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady asilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley;even Lydia was toomuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressinglycivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; andaddressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happyhe would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all gratefulpleasure;he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity ofwaiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged togo the next day for a short time.Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied;quitted the house under thedelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations ofsettlements,  carriages,wedding clothes, she should undoubtedlysee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or fourmonths. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thoughtwith equal certainty,with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children;though themanthe match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of eachwas eclipsed by Mr. BingleyNetherfield.[Illustration:     “to assure you in the most animated language”]CHAPTER XIX.[Illustration]The next day opened a  scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made hisdeclaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, ashis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday,havingno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at themoment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all theobservances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On findingMrs. Bennet, Elizabeth,one of the younger girls together, soonafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--“May  madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in thecourse of this morning?”Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.Bennet instantly answered,--“Oh dear!  certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sureshe can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” Andgathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabethcalled out,--“Dear ma’am, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuseme. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I amgoing away myself.”“ no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you will stay where you are.” Andupon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexedembarrassed looks, aboutto escape,“ I _insist_ upon your stayinghearingMr. Collins.”Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction;a moment’sconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get itover as soonas quietly as possible, she sat down again,triedto conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were dividedbetween distressdiversion. Mrs. BennetKitty walked off,assoon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far fromdoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. Youwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this littleunwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respectedmother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purportof my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you todissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost assoon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of myfuture life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on thissubject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons formarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the designof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run awaywith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could notuse the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, andhe continued,--“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing forevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the exampleof matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will addvery greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought tohave mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice andrecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of callingpatroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unaskedtoo!) on this subject;it was but the very Saturday night before Ileft Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson wasarranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, youmust marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose agentlewoman for _my_ sake,for your _own_; let her be an active,useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a smallincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon asyou can, bring her to Hunsford,I will visit her.’ Allow me, by theway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice andkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of theadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyondanything I can describe;your witvivacity, I think, must beacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silencerespectwhich her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my generalintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my viewswere directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where Iassure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, thatbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honouredfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfymyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, thatthe loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholyevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not befor several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin,Iflatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothingremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of theviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, andshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am wellaware that it could not be complied with;that one thousand poundsin the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’sdecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,therefore, I shall be uniformly silent:you may assure yourself thatno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.“You are too hasty, sir,”“You forget that I have made noanswer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks forthe compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour ofyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than declinethem.”“I am not now to learn,”with a formal wave of thehand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of theman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for theirfavour;that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even athird time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you havejust said,shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”“ sir,”“your hope is rather anextraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am notone of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are sodaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a secondtime. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_happy,I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world whowould make _you_ so.  were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, Iam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for thesituation.”“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at alldisapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour ofseeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,economy,other amiable qualifications.”“ Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You mustgive me leave to judge for myself,pay me the compliment ofbelieving what I say. I wish you very happyvery rich,byrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of yourfeelings with regard to my family,may take possession of Longbournestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may beconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thusspoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thusaddressed her,--“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, Ishall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now givenme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because Iknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on thefirst application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much toencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of thefemale character.”“Really, Mr. Collins,”with some warmth, “you puzzle meexceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the formof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way asmay convince you of its being one.”“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that yourrefusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons forbelieving it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my handis unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer wouldbe any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connectionswith the family of De Bourgh,my relationship to your own, arecircumstances highly in my favour;you should take it into furtherconsideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by nomeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Yourportion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo theeffects of your lovelinessamiable qualifications. As I must,therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, Ishall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love bysuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kindof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I wouldrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank youagainagain for the honour you have done me in your proposals, butto accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respectforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegantfemale intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking thetruth from her heart.”“You are uniformly charming!”with an air of awkwardgallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the expressauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail ofbeing acceptable.”To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make noreply,immediatelyin silence withdrew; determined, that if hepersisted in considering her repeated refusals as flatteringencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be utteredin such a manner as must be decisive,whose behaviour at least couldnot be mistaken for the affectationcoquetry of an elegant female.[Illustration]CHAPTER XX.[Illustration]Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of hissuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibuleto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open thedoorwith quick step pass her towards the staircase, than sheentered the breakfast-room,congratulated both himherself inwarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collinsreceivedreturned these felicitations with equal pleasure,thenproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the resultof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since therefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flowfrom her bashful modestythe genuine delicacy of her character.This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have beenglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encouragehim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,and could not help saying so.“But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,”“that Lizzy shall bebrought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She isa very headstrong, foolish girl,does not know her own interest; butI will _make_ her know it.”“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,”“but if sheis really headstrongfoolish, I know not whether she wouldaltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, whonaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, sheactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not toforce her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects oftemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,”alarmed. “Lizzy isonly headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is asgood-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, andwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to herhusband, called out, as she entered the library,--“ Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.You must comemake Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she willnot have him;if you do not make haste he will change his mind andnot have _her_.”Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered,fixed themon her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered byher communication.“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,”when she hadfinished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”“Of Mr. CollinsLizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.”“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon hermarrying him.”“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”Mrs. Bennet rang the bell,Miss Elizabeth was summoned to thelibrary.“Come here, child,”“I have sent foryou on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has madeyou an offer of marriage. Is it true?”Elizabeth replied that it was.“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”“I have, sir.”“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon youraccepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”“ or I will never see her again.”“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you mustbe a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see youagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins,I will never see you againif you _do_.”Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded theaffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised meto _insist_ upon her marrying him.”“My dear,”“I have two small favours to request.First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on thepresent occasion; and, secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have thelibrary to myself as soon as may be.” however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, didMrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth againagain;coaxedthreatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane inher interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declinedinterfering;Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, andsometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her mannervaried, however, her determination never did.Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousincould refuse him;though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no otherway. His regard for her was quite imaginary;the possibility of herdeserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spendthe day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying toher, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is suchfun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins hasmade an offer to she will not have him.”[Illustration:     “they entered the breakfast room”]Charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty,who came to tell the same s;no sooner had they entered thebreakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began onthe subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion,entreatingher to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of herfamily. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,”in a melancholy tone;“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; I am cruelly used,nobody feels for my poor nerves.”Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of JaneElizabeth.“Ay, there she comes,”“looking as unconcerned asmay be,caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided shecan have her own way. But I tell you what, Miss  if you take itinto your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who isto maintain you when your father is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keepyou--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I toldyou in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talkingto undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talkingto anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can haveno great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But itis always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that anyattempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them tillthey were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more statelythan usual,on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--“ I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, andlet Mr. Collinsme have a little conversation together.”Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, JaneKitty followed, butLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could;Charlotte,detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries afterherselfall her family were very minute,then by a littlecuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the windowpretendingnot to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projectedconversation:--“ Mr. Collins!”“My dear madam,”“let us be for ever silent on this point.Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked hisdispleasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation toinevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young manwho has been so fortunate as I have been, in early preferment; and, Itrust, I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of mypositive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for Ihave often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when theblessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.You will not,  consider me as showing any disrespect to yourfamily, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to yourdaughter’s favour, without having paid yourselfMr. Bennet thecompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted mydismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are allliable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with dueconsideration for the advantage of all your family;if my _manner_has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologize.”[Illustration]CHAPTER XXI.[Illustration]The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, andElizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarilyattending it,occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, notby embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but bystiffness of mannerresentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke toher;the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible ofhimself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whosecivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, andespecially to her friend.The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill humour or illhealth. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabethhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan didnot appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone onSaturday,to Saturday he still meant to stay.After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickhamwere returned,to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.He joined them on their entering the town,attended them to theiraunt’s, where his regretvexationthe concern of everybody werewell talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledgedthat the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.“I found,”“as the time drew near, that I had better not meetMr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for somany hours together, might be more than I could bear,that scenesmight arise unpleasant to more than myself.”She highly approved his forbearance;they had leisure for a fulldiscussion of it,for all the commendations which they civillybestowed on each other, as Wickhamanother officer walked back withthem to Longbourn,during the walk he particularly attended to her.His accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all thecompliment it offered to herself;it was most acceptable as anoccasion of introducing him to her fathermother.[Illustration: “”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it camefrom Netherfield,was opened immediately. The envelope contained asheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’sfair, flowing hand;Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change asshe read it,saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.Jane recollected herself soon;putting the letter away, tried tojoin, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: butElizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attentioneven from Wickham;no sooner had hehis companion taken leave,than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When theyhad gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This isfrom Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.The whole party have left Netherfield by this time,are on their wayto town;without any intention of coming back again. You shall hearwhat she says.”She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the informationof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend toregret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, mydearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy manyreturns of that delightful intercourse we have known,in themeanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequentmostunreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To thesehigh-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility ofdistrust;though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, shesaw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that theirabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there;asto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must sooncease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.“It is unlucky,”after a short pause, “that you should not beable to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we nothope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looksforward, may arrive earlier than she is aware,that the delightfulintercourse you have known as friends will be reed with yet greatersatisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London bythem.”“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return intoHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you.“‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business whichtook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as weare certain it cannot be so,at the same time convinced that whenCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we havedetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spendhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance arealready there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearestfriend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that Idespair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound inthe gaieties which that season generally brings,that your beauxwill be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three ofwhom we shall deprive you.’“It is evident by this,”“that he comes back no more thiswinter.”“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.”“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing; he is his own master.But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage whichparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_. ‘Mr. Darcy isimpatient to see his sister;to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcelyless eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy hasher equal for beauty, elegance,accomplishments;the affectionshe inspires in Louisamyself is heightened into something stillmore interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her beinghereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned toyou my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the countrywithout confiding them,I trust you will not esteem themunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will havefrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; herrelations all wish the connection as much as his own;a sister’spartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles mostcapable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances tofavour an attachment,nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearestJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happinessof so many?’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” saidJane, as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expresslydeclare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference;thatif she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (mostkindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on thesubject?”“ there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”“Most willingly.”“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother isin love with youwants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him totown in the hope of keeping him there,tries to persuade you that hedoes not care about you.”Jane shook her head.“ Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen youtogether can doubt his affection;   cannot: sheis not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But thecase is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them;sheis the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notionthat when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less troublein achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity,Idare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.  mydearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingleytells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallestdegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you onTuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, insteadof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”“If we thought alike of ”“yourrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know thefoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceivinganyone;all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceivedherself.”“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since youwill not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.You have now done your duty by her,must fret no longer.”“ my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, inaccepting a man whose sistersfriends are all wishing him to marryelsewhere?”“You must decide for yourself,”“and if, upon maturedeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters ismore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you,by all means, to refuse him.”“How can you talk so?”faintly smiling; “you must know, that,though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I couldnot hesitate.”“I did not think you would;that being the case, I cannot consideryour situation with much compassion.”“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never berequired. A thousand things may arise in six months.”The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmostcontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’sinterested wishes;she could not for a moment suppose that thosewishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young manso totally independent of everyone.She represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt onthe subject,had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.Jane’s temper was not desponding;she was gradually led to hope,though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, thatBingley would return to Netherfield,answer every wish of her heart.They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of thefamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happento go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. Afterlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation ofthinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again,soon dining atLongbourn;the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would takecare to have two full courses.[Illustration]CHAPTER XXII.[Illustration]The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases;again, during thechief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in goodhumour,”“and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, andthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This wasvery amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabethhad any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure herfrom any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towardsherself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme;appearances were sofavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almostsure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.But here she did injustice to the fireindependence of hischaracter; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the nextmorning with admirable slyness,hasten to Lucas Lodge to throwhimself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail toconjecture his design,he was not willing to have the attempt knowntill its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almostsecure,with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. Hisreception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucasperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, andinstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little hadshe dared to hope that so much loveeloquence awaited her there.In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both;asthey entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day thatwas to make him the happiest of men;though such a solicitation mustbe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle withhis happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature mustguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for itscontinuance;Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure anddisinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon thatestablishment were gained.Sir WilliamLady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s presentcircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whomthey could give little fortune;his prospects of future wealth wereexceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with moreinterest than the matter had ever[Illustration:     “”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; andSir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collinsshould be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highlyexpedient that both hehis wife should make their appearance at St.James’s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on theoccasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or twosooner than they might otherwise have done;the boys were relievedfrom their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotteherself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point,had timeto consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr.Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society wasirksome,his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he wouldbe her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourableprovision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, howeveruncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservativefrom want. This preservative she had now obtained;at the age oftwenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the goodluck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was thesurprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship shevalued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, andprobably would blame her;though her resolution was not to beshaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolvedto give her the information herself;therefore charged Mr. Collins,when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what hadpassed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course verydutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for thecuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very directquestions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade,he wasat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing topublish his prosperous love.As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any ofthe family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladiesmoved for the night;Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness andcordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again,whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.“My dear madam,”“this invitation is particularlygratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive;youmay be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon aspossible.”They were all astonished;Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish forso speedy a return, immediately said,--“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, mygood sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk ofoffending your patroness.”“My dear sir,”“I am particularly obliged to youfor this friendly caution,you may depend upon my not taking somaterial a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”“You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than herdispleasure;if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to usagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by suchaffectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receivefrom me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark ofyour regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shallnow take the liberty of wishing them healthhappiness, not exceptingmy cousin Elizabeth.”With proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equallysurprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wishedto understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one ofher younger girls,Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was asolidity in his reflections which often struck her;though by nomeans so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read andimprove himself by such an example as hers, he might become a veryagreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of thiskind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast,in aprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with herfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: butthat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibilityas that she could encourage him herself;her astonishment wasconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, andshe could not help crying out,--“Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, impossible!”The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling herstory gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct areproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regainedher composure,calmly replied,--“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incrediblethat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”But Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effortfor it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that theprospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her,that shewished her all imaginable happiness.“I see what you are feeling,”“you must be surprised,very much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will besatisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I neverwas. I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’scharacter, connections,situation in life, I am convinced that mychance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast onentering the marriage state.”Elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay muchlonger;Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. Itwas a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of sounsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offersof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being nowaccepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony wasnot exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possiblethat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every betterfeeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was amost humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracingherself,sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing convictionthat it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lotshe had chosen.[Illustration:     “.”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER XXIII.[Illustration]Elizabeth was sitting with her mothersisters, reflecting on whatshe had heard,doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter toannounce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between thehouses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance thanpoliteness, protested he must be entirely mistaken;Lydia, alwaysunguardedoften uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you knowthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have bornewithout anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carriedhim through it all;though he begged leave to be positive as to thetruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with themost forbearing courtesy.Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasanta situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, bymentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; andendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mothersisters,by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which shewas readily joined by Jane,by making a variety of remarks on thehappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent characterof Mr. Collins,the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.Mrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal whileSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelingsfound a rapid vent.  she persisted in disbelievingthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collinshad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happytogether; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Twoinferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, thatElizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief;the other, thatshe herself had been barbarously used by them all;on these twopoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing couldconsolenothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out herresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth withoutscolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir Williamor Lady Lucas without being rude;many months were gone before shecould at all forgive their daughter.Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion,suchas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; forit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he hadbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, andmore foolish than his daughter!Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she saidless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty andLydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only aclergyman;it affected them in no other way than as a piece of sto spread at Meryton.Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort onMrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married;shecalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looksill-natured remarks might have beenenough to drive happiness away.Between ElizabethCharlotte there was a restraint which kept themmutually silent on the subject;Elizabeth felt persuaded that noreal confidence could ever subsist between them again. Herdisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to hersister, of whose rectitudedelicacy she was sure her opinion couldnever be shaken,for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, asBingley had now been gone a week,nothing was heard of his return.Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter,was countingthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promisedletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to theirfather,written with all the solemnity of gratitude which atwelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. Afterdischarging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained theaffection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas,then explainedthat it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he hadbeen so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again atLongbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;for  he added, so heartily approved his marriage, thatshe wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted wouldbe an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an earlyday for making him the happiest of men.Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter ofpleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed tocomplain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should cometo Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenientand exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the housewhile her health was so indifferent,lovers were of all people themost disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet,theygave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continuedabsence.Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day afterday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than thereport which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more toNetherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.Bennet,which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalousfalsehood.Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but thathis sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as shewas to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness,sodishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent itsfrequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of MissDarcythe amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, forthe strength of his attachment.As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, morepainful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous ofconcealing;between herselfElizabeth, therefore, the subjectwas never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, anhour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express herimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if hedid not come back she should think herself very ill-used. It needed allJane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerabletranquillity.Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but hisreception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on hisfirst introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved themfrom a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent byhim at Lucas Lodge,he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in timeto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.[Illustration:     “__”]Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention ofanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, andwherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight ofMiss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, sheregarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to seethem, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; andwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced thatthey were talking of the Longbourn estate,resolving to turn herselfand her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead. Shecomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.“ Mr. Bennet,”“it is very hard to think that CharlotteLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forcedto make way for _her_,live to see her take my place in it!”“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope forbetter things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.”This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet; and, therefore, instead ofmaking any answer, she went on as before.“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it wasnot for the entail, I should not mind it.”“What should not you mind?”“I should not mind anything at all.”“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of suchinsensibility.”“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. Howanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s owndaughters I cannot understand;all for the sake of Mr. Collins, too!Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.[Illustration]CHAPTER XXIV.[Illustration]Miss Bingley’s letter arrived,put an end to doubt. The very firstsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London forthe winter,concluded with her brother’s regret at not having hadtime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he leftthe country.Hope was over, entirely over;when Jane could attend to the rest ofthe letter, she found little, except the professed affection of thewriter, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupiedthe chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on;Carolineboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy,ventured to predictthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her formerletter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being aninmate of Mr. Darcy’s house,mentioned with raptures some plans ofthe latter with regard to  furniture.Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concernfor her sisterresentment against all others. To Caroline’sassertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid nocredit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than shehad ever done;much as she had always been disposed to like him, shecould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easinessof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slaveof his designing friends,led him to sacrifice his own happiness tothe caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, beenthe only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it inwhatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, asshe thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, onwhich reflection would be long indulged,must be unavailing. Shecould think of nothing else;yet, whether Bingley’s regard hadreally died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;whether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it hadescaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion ofhim must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’ssituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings toElizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after alonger irritation than usual about Netherfieldits master, she couldnot help saying,--“O that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have noidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But Iwill not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot,we shallall be as we were before.”Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but saidnothing.“You doubt me,”“indeed, you have noreason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of myacquaintance but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, andnothing to reproach him with. Thank God I have not _that_ pain. A littletime, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----”With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side,that ithas done no harm to anyone but myself.”“My dear Jane,”“you are too good. Your sweetnessand disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say toyou. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as youdeserve.”Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit,threw backthe praise on her sister’s warm affection.“”“this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all theworld respectable,are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only wantto think _you_ perfect,you set yourself against it. Do not beafraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on yourprivilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few peoplewhom I really love,still fewer of whom I think well. The more I seeof the world the more am I dissatisfied with it;every day confirmsmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters,of thelittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either meritor sense. I have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention,the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view itis unaccountable!”“My dear  do not give way to such feelings as these. They willruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference ofsituationtemper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, andCharlotte’s prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of alarge family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match;beready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something likeregardesteem for our cousin.”“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one elsecould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded thatCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of herunderstanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is aconceited, pompous, -minded, silly man: you know he is, as well asI do;you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries himcannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, thoughit is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,change the meaning of principleintegrity, nor endeavour to persuadeyourself or me, that selfishness is prudence,insensibility ofdanger security for happiness.”“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” repliedJane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happytogether. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. Youmentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreatyou, dear  not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, andsaying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancyourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young manto be always so guardedcircumspect. It is very often nothing butour own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more thanit does.”“And men take care that they should.”“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no ideaof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”said Elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make othersunhappy, there may be errorthere may be misery. Thoughtlessness,want of attention to other people’s feelings,want of resolution,will do the business.”“And do you impute it to either of those?”“Yes; to the last. But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what Ithink of persons you esteem. Stop me, whilst you can.”“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”“ in conjunction with his friend.”“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They canonly wish his happiness;if he is attached to me no other woman cansecure it.”“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides hishappiness: they may wish his increase of wealthconsequence; theymay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, greatconnections,pride.”“Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They haveknown her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they loveher better.  whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikelythey should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would thinkherself at liberty to do it, unless there were something veryobjectionable? If they believed him attached to me they would not try topart us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such anaffection, you make everybody acting unnaturallywrong,me mostunhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having beenmistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison ofwhat I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take itin the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish;from this time Mr. Bingley’sname was scarcely ever mentioned between them.Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonderrepine at his returning nomore;though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not accountfor it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering itwith less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of whatshe did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merelythe effect of a commontransient liking, which ceased when he sawher no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted atthe time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s bestcomfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, ”oneday, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Nextto being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now andthen. It is something to think of,gives her a sort of distinctionamong her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear tobe long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough atMeryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickhambe your man. He is a pleasant fellow,would jilt you creditably.”“ sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must notall expect Jane’s good fortune.”“True,”“but it is a comfort to think that, whatever ofthat kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who willalways make the most of it.”Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloomwhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbournfamily. They saw him often,to his other recommendations was nowadded that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had alreadyheard, his claims on Mr. Darcy,all that he had suffered from him,was now openly acknowledgedpublicly canvassed;everybody waspleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before theyhad known anything of the matter.Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be anyextenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society ofHertfordshire: her mildsteady candour always pleaded forallowances,urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody elseMr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.[Illustration]CHAPTER XXV.[Illustration]After a week spent in professions of loveschemes of felicity, Mr.Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival ofSaturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on hisside by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason tohope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the daywould be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leaveof his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wishedhis fair cousins healthhappiness again,promised their fatheranother letter of thanks.On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving herbrotherhis wife, who came, as usual, to spend the Christmas atLongbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatlysuperior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfieldladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived bytrade,within view of his own warehouses, could have been sowell-bredagreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years youngerthan Mrs. BennetMrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegantwoman,a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces. Between the twoeldestherself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.They had frequently been staying with her in town.The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business, on her arrival, was todistribute her presentsdescribe the est fashions. When this wasdone, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate,much to complain of. Theyhad all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of hergirls had been on the point of marriage,after all there was nothingin it.“I do not blame Jane,”“for Jane would have got Mr.Bingley if she could.  Lizzy!  sister! it is very hard to thinkthat she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not itbeen for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will havea daughter married before I have,that Longbourn estate is just asmuch entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people, indeed,sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it ofthem, but so it is. It makes me very nervouspoorly, to be thwartedso in my own family,to have neighbours who think of themselvesbefore anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is thegreatest of comforts,I am very glad to hear what you tell us oflong sleeves.”Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this s had been given before, inthe course of JaneElizabeth’s correspondence with her, made hersister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned theconversation.When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.“It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,”“Iam sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man,such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a prettygirl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easilyforgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.”[Illustration:     “”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“An excellent consolation in its way,”“but it will notdo for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happenthat the interference of friends will persuade a young man ofindependent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently inlove with only a few days before.”“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, sodoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is asoften applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’sacquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_Mr. Bingley’s love?”“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quiteinattentive to other people,wholly engrossed by her. Every timethey met, it was more decidedremarkable. At his own ball heoffended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance;Ispoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. Could there befiner symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”“ yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. PoorJane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not getover it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; youwould have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she wouldbe prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be ofservice--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful asanything.”Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal,felt persuadedof her sister’s ready acquiescence.“”“that no consideration with regard tothis young man will influence her. We live in so different a part oftown, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we goout so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,unless he really comes to see her.”“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of hisfriend,Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such apart of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may,perhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but hewould hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from itsimpurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, Mr. Bingleynever stirs without him.”“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Janecorrespond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.”“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.” in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place thispoint, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s beingwithheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject whichconvinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirelyhopeless. It was possible,sometimes she thought it probable, thathis affection might be re-animated,the influence of his friendssuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’sattractions.Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure;theBingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as shehoped, by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, shemight occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger ofseeing him.The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn;what with the Philipses,the Lucases,the officers, there was not a day without itsengagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainmentof her brothersister, that they did not once sit down to a familydinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers alwaysmade part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; andon these occasions Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’swarm commendation of him, ly observed them both. Without supposingthem, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preferenceof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy;sheresolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she leftHertfordshire,represent to her the imprudence of encouraging suchan attachment.To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very partof Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, manyacquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there sincethe death of Darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his powerto give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had beenin the way of procuring.Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley,known the late Mr. Darcy bycharacter perfectly well. Here, consequently, was an inexhaustiblesubject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley withthe minute description which Wickham could give,in bestowing hertribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she wasdelighting both himherself. On being made acquainted with thepresent Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something ofthat gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which mightagree with it;was confident, at last, that she recollected havingheard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,ill-natured boy.[Illustration:     “”]CHAPTER XXVI.[Illustration]Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctuallykindly given onthe first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: afterhonestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--“You are too sensible a girl,  to fall in love merely because youare warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speakingopenly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involveyourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want offortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against_him_: he is a most interesting young man;if he had the fortune heought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--youmust not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense,we allexpect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution andgood conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”“I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”“ then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care ofmyself,of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if Ican prevent it.”“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”“I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love withMr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached tome--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudenceof it.  _that_ abominable  My father’s opinion of me doesme the greatest honour;I should be miserable to forfeit it. Myfather, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, Ishould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; butsince we see, every day, that where there is affection young people areseldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering intoengagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so manyof my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know thatit would be wiser to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, isnot to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself hisfirst object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. Inshort, I will do my best.”“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so veryoften. At least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”“As I did the other day,”with a conscious smile; “verytrue, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imaginethat he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has beenso frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to thenecessity of constant company for her friends. But really,upon myhonour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest;now I hope youare satisfied.”Her aunt assured her that she was;Elizabeth, having thanked her forthe kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advicebeing given on such a point without being resented.Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quittedby the GardinersJane; but, as he took up his abode with theLucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. Hismarriage was now fast approaching;she was at length so far resignedas to think it inevitable,even repeatedly to say, in an ill-naturedtone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be thewedding-day,on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; andwhen she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’sungraciousreluctant good wishes,sincerely affected herself,accompanied her out of the room. As they went down stairs together,Charlotte said,--“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”“_That_ you certainly shall.”“And I have another favour to ask. ”“We shall often meet,  in Hertfordshire.”“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, tocome to Hunsford.”Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in thevisit.“My fatherMaria are to come to me in March,”“andI hope you will consent to be of the party.  Eliza, you will beas welcome to me as either of them.”The wedding took place: the bridebridegroom set off for Kent fromthe church door,everybody had as much to say or to hear on thesubject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend,theircorrespondence was as regularfrequent as it ever had been: that itshould be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could neveraddress her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for thesake of what had been rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letterswere received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but becuriosity to know how she would speak of her  home, how she wouldlike how happy she would dare pronounce herself tobe; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotteexpressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. Shewrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts,mentioned nothingwhich she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, androads, were all to her taste,Lady Catherine’s behaviour was mostfriendlyobliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford andRosings rationally softened;Elizabeth perceived that she must waitfor her own visit there, to know the rest.Jane had already written a few lines to her sister, to announce theirsafe arrival in London;when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped itwould be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatiencegenerally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing orhearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing thather last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident beenlost.“My aunt,”“is going to-morrow into that part of thetown,I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”She wrote again when the visit was paid,she had seen Miss “I did not think Caroline in spirits,”“but she was veryglad to see me,reproached me for giving her no notice of my comingto London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so muchengaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found thatMiss Darcy was expected to dinner: I wish I could see her. My visit wasnot long, as CarolineMrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shallsoon see them here.”Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her thataccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.Four weeks passed away,Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured topersuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer beblind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morningfor a fortnight,inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, thevisitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yetmore, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herselfno longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sisterwill prove what she felt:--     “My dearest Lizzy will,  be incapable of triumphing in     her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me.  my     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me     obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should     be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;    not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she     did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she     made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a     word of wishing to see me again,was, in every respect, so     altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I     cannot help blaming, her. She was very wrong in singling me out as     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on     her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been     acting wrong,because I am very sure that anxiety for her     brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther;    though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me;so     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may     feel on his behalf is naturalamiable. I cannot but wonder,     however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all     cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself;    yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot     understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be     almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of     duplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful     thought,think only of what will make me happy, your affection,    the invariable kindness of my dear uncleaunt. Let me hear     from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not     with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at     Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir WilliamMaria. I am     sure you will be very comfortable there.“”This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as sheconsidered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would noteven wish for any real of his attentions. His character sunk on everyreview of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possibleadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.Darcy’s sister, as, by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantlyregret what he had thrown away.Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promiseconcerning that gentleman,required information;Elizabeth hadsuch to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than toherself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough tosee it all, but she could see itwrite of it without material pain.Her heart had been but slightly touched,her vanity was satisfiedwith believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortunepermitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the mostremarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himselfagreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case thanin Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able tosuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she wasready to allow it a wisedesirable measure for both,could verysincerely wish him happy.All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating thecircumstances, she thus went on:--“I am now convinced, my dear aunt,that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced thatpureelevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordialtowards _him_, they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot findout that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to thinkher a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. Mywatchfulness has been effectual;though I should certainly be a moreinteresting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in lovewith him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. KittyLydia takehis defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the waysof the world,not yet open to the mortifying conviction thathandsome young men must have something to live on as well as theplain.”[Illustration:     “”]CHAPTER XXVII.[Illustration]With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family,otherwisediversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty andsometimes cold, did JanuaryFebruary pass away. March was to takeElizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously ofgoing thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on theplan,she gradually learned to consider it herself with greaterpleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desireof seeing Charlotte again,weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.There was novelty in the scheme;as, with such a mothersuchuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little changewas not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would, moreover, giveher a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would havebeen very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,and was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She wasto accompany Sir Williamhis second daughter. The improvement ofspending a night in London was added in time,the plan became asperfect as plan could be.The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that hetold her to write to him,almost promised to answer her letter.The farewell between herselfMr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; onhis side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget thatElizabeth had been the first to exciteto deserve his attention, thefirst to listento pity, the first to be admired;in his mannerof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of whatshe was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh,trusting theiropinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, therewas a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her tohim with a most sincere regard;she parted from him convinced, that,whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiableand pleasing.Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her thinkhim less agreeable. Sir William Lucas,his daughter Maria, agood-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to saythat could be worth hearing,were listened to with about as muchdelight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, butshe had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing  ofthe wonders of his presentationknighthood;his civilities wereworn out, like his information.It was a journey of only twenty-four miles,they began it so earlyas to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’sdoor, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: whenthey entered the passage, she was there to welcome them,Elizabeth,looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful andlovely as ever.  were a troop of little boysgirls,whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them towait in the drawing-room,whose shyness, as they had not seen herfor a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy andkindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle andshopping,the evening at one of the theatres.Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was hersister;she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply toher minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support herspirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, tohope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her theparticulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, andrepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane andherself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up theacquaintance.Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, andcomplimented her on bearing it so well.“”“what sort of girl is Miss King? Ishould be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,between the mercenarythe prudent motive? Where does discretion end,and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,because it would be imprudent;now, because he is trying to get agirl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he ismercenary.”“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall knowwhat to think.”“”“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s deathmade her mistress of this fortune?”“No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be formaking love to a girl whom he did not care about,who was equallypoor?”“But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her sosoon after this event.”“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegantdecorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,why should _we_?”“_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her beingdeficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”“”“have it as you choose. _He_ shall bemercenary,_she_ shall be foolish.”“  that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”“ if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live inDerbyshire;their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are notmuch better. I am sick of them all. Thank heaven! I am going to-morrowwhere I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who hasneither manners nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only onesworth knowing, after all.”“”Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had theunexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncleaunt ina tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.“” said Mrs.Gardiner; “”No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth,heracceptance of the invitation was most readygrateful. “My dear, dearaunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You give mefresh lifevigour. Adieu to disappointmentspleen. What are mento rocksmountains?  what hours of transport we shall spend! Andwhen we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, withoutbeing able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know wherewe have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains,and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, whenwe attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrellingabout its relative situation. Let _our_ first effusions be lessinsupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”[Illustration:     “”]CHAPTER XXVIII.[Illustration]Every object in the next day’s journey was interesting toElizabeth;her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she hadseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was insearch of the Parsonage,every turning expected to bring it in view.The paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side. Elizabethsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to theroad, the house standing in it, the green palesthe laurel hedge,everything declared they were arriving. Mr. CollinsCharlotteappeared at the door,the carriage stopped at the small gate, whichled by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nodssmiles ofthe whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicingat the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with theliveliest pleasure,Elizabeth was moremore satisfied withcoming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She sawinstantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:his formal civility was just what it had been;he detained her someminutes at the gate to hearsatisfy his inquiries after all herfamily. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out theneatness of the entrance, taken into the house;as soon as they werein the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatiousformality, to his humble abode,punctually repeated all his wife’soffers of refreshment.Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory;she could not helpfancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as ifwishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But thougheverything seemed neatcomfortable, she was not able to gratify himby any sigh of repentance;rather looked with wonder at her friend,that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye onCharlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in generalCharlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admireevery article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to thefender, to give an account of their journey,of all that hadhappened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in thegarden, which was largewell laid out,to the cultivation ofwhich he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his mostrespectable pleasures;Elizabeth admired the command of countenancewith which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, andowned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the waythrough every walkcross walk,scarcely allowing them aninterval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed outwith a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number thefields in every direction,could tell how many trees there were inthe most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or whichthe country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared withthe prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees thatbordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was ahandsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a whitefrost, turned back;while Sir William accompanied him, Charlottetook her sisterfriend over the house, extremely well pleased,probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’shelp. It was rather small, but well builtconvenient;everythingwas fitted uparranged with a neatnessconsistency, of whichElizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could beforgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout,byCharlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be oftenforgotten.She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. Itwas spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joiningin, observed,--“ Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherinede Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church,I need not say you willbe delighted with her. She is all affabilitycondescension,Idoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice whenservice is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she willinclude youmy sister Maria in every invitation with which shehonours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte ischarming. We dine at Rosings twice every week,are never allowed towalk home. Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I_should_ say, one of her Ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”“” addedCharlotte, “”“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort ofwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire s, andtelling again what had been already written;when it closed,Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate uponCharlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,and composure in bearing with, her husband,to acknowledge that itwas all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit wouldpass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatiousinterruptions of Mr. Collins,the gaieties of their intercoursewith Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting readyfor a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house inconfusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody runningupstairs in a violent hurry,calling loudly after her. She openedthe door,met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless withagitation, cried out,--[Illustration:     “”[Copyright 1894 by George Allen.]]“ my dear Eliza! pray make hastecome into the dining-room, forthere is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Makehaste,come down this moment.”Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more;and down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in questof this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in a low phaeton at thegarden gate.“”“I expected at least that the pigswere got into the garden,here is nothing but Lady Catherineherdaughter!”“” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not LadyCatherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. Theother is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a littlecreature. Who would have thought she could be so thinsmall!”“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.Why does she not come in?”“ Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favourswhen Miss De Bourgh comes in.”“”struck with other ideas. “Shelooks sicklycross.  she will do for him very well. She willmake him a very proper wife.”Mr. CollinsCharlotte were both standing at the gate in conversationwith the ladies;Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, wasstationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatnessbefore him,constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked thatway.At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, andthe others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the twogirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, whichCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was askedto dine at Rosings the next day.[Illustration:     ‘.’[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER XXIX.[Illustration]Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wonderingvisitors,of letting them see her civility towards himselfhiswife, was exactly what he had wished for;that an opportunity ofdoing it should be given so soon was such an instance of LadyCatherine’s condescension as he k not how to admire enough.“”“that I should not have been at all surprised byher Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink teaspend the eveningat Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, thatit would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dinethere (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) soimmediately after your arrival?”“” replied Sir William,“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, whichmy situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, suchinstances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but theirvisit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in whatthey were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, andso splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said toElizabeth,--“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. LadyCatherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us whichbecomes herselfdaughter. I would advise you merely to put onwhatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasionfor anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you forbeing simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rankpreserved.”While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their differentdoors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very muchobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts ofher Ladyship,her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,who had been little used to company;she looked forward to herintroduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had doneto his presentation at St. James’s.As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mileacross the park. Every park has its beautyits prospects; andElizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in suchraptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire,was butslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of thehouse,his relation of what the glazing altogether had originallycost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every momentincreasing,even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of LadyCatherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents ormiraculous virtue,the mere stateliness of moneyrank shethought she could witness without trepidation.From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with arapturous air, the fine proportionfinished ornaments, they followedthe servants through an antechamber to the room where her daughter,Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her Ladyship, with greatcondescension, arose to receive them;as Mrs. Collins had settled itwith her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it wasperformed in a proper manner, without any of those apologiesthankswhich he would have thought necessary.In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completelyawed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courageenough to make a very low bow,take his seat without saying a word;and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edgeof her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herselfquite equal to the scene,could observe the three ladies before hercomposedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-markedfeatures, which might once have been handsome. Her air was notconciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make hervisitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable bysilence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone asmarked her self-importance,brought Mr. Wickham immediately toElizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, shebelieved Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.When, after examining the mother, in whose countenancedeportmentshe soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on thedaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at herbeing so thinso small. There was neither in figure nor face anylikeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was palesickly: herfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant;she spoke verylittle, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearancethere was nothing remarkable,who was entirely engaged in listeningto what she said,placing a screen in the proper direction beforeher eyes.After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows toadmire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worthlooking at in the summer.The dinner was exceedingly handsome,there were all the servants,and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as hehad likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, byher Ladyship’s desire,looked as if he felt that life could furnishnothing greater. He carvedatepraised with delighted alacrity;and every dish was commended first by him,then by Sir William, whowas now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in amanner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But LadyCatherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration,gave mostgracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a noveltyto them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was readyto speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated betweenCharlotteMiss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged inlistening to the latter said not a word to her allthe dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching howlittle Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish andfearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,and the gentlemen did nothing but eatadmire.When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to bedone but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without anyintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on everysubject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to haveher judgment controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domesticconcerns familiarlyminutely,gave her a great deal of advice asto the management of them all; told her how everything ought to beregulated in so small a family as hers,instructed her as to thecare of her cowsher poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing wasbeneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with anoccasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse withMrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria andElizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she kthe least,who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sistersshe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any ofthem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where theyhad been educated, what carriage her father kept,what had been hermother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of herquestions, but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine thenobserved,--“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think? For yoursake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see nooccasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thoughtnecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you playsing, MissBennet?”“”“Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Ourinstrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try itsome day. Do your sisters playsing?”“”“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The MissWebbs all play,their father has not so good an income as yours. Doyou draw?”“ not at all.”“”“”“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mothershould have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”“”“”“”“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at homewithout a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother musthave been quite a slave to your education.”Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had notbeen the case.“Then who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you musthave been neglected.”“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us aswished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged toread,had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to beidle certainly might.”“Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent;if I hadknown your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engageone. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steadyand regular instruction,nobody but a governess can give it. It iswonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in thatway. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four niecesof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; andit was but the other day that I recommended another young person, whowas merely accidentally mentioned to me,the family are quitedelighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’scalling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘LadyCatherine,’‘.’ Are any of youryounger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”“”“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. Theyounger ones out before the elder are married! Your younger sisters mustbe very young?”“ my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be muchin company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard uponyounger sisters that they should not have their share of society andamusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination tomarry early. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youthas the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it wouldnot be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”“” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedlyfor so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”“” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “yourLadyship can hardly expect me to own it.”Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had everdared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.“You cannot be more than twenty, --therefore you need notconceal your age.”“”When the gentlemen had joined them,tea was over, the card tableswere placed.  Sir William,Mr.Mrs. Collins satdown to quadrille;as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, thetwo girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up herparty. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable wasuttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinsonexpressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, orhaving too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at theother table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakesof the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collinswas employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking herfor every fish he won,apologizing if he thought he won too many.Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotesand noble names.When Lady Catherineher daughter had played as long as they chose,the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,gratefully accepted,immediately ordered. The party then gatheredround the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they wereto have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by thearrival of the coach;with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.Collins’s side,as many bows on Sir William’s, they departed. Assoon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by hercousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. Buther commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no meanssatisfy Mr. Collins,he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship’spraise into his own hands.[Illustration]CHAPTER XXX.[Illustration]Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was longenough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,and of her possessing such a husbandsuch a neighbour as were notoften met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted hismornings to driving him out in his gig,showing him the country: butwhen he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of hercousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfastand dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or inreadingwriting,looking out of window in his own book room,which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not preferthe dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room,had apleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellentreason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have beenmuch less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; andshe gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, andwere indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages wentalong,how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happenedalmost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage,hada few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely everprevailed on to get out.Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, andnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livingsto be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so manyhours. Nowthen they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room duringthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangementof the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence;if sheaccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of findingout that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in thecommission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistratein her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her byMr. Collins;whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to bequarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into thevillage to settle their differences, silence their complaints,scoldthem into harmonyplenty.[Illustration:     “”]The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;and, allowing for the loss of Sir William,there being only onecard-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpartof the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of livingof the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses’ reach. This,however, was no evil to Elizabeth,upon the whole she spent her timecomfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation withCharlotte,the weather was so fine for the time of year, that shehad often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk,whereshe frequently went while the others were calling on  wasalong the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there wasa nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, andwhere she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.In this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.Easter was approaching,the week preceding it was to bring anaddition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must beimportant. Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcywas expected there in the course of a few weeks;though there werenot many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming wouldfurnish one comparatively  to look at in their Rosings parties, andshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on himwere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destinedby  who talked of his coming with the greatestsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, andseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen byMiss Lucasherself.His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walkingthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,in order to have[Illustration:“.”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriageturned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On thefollowing morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There weretwo nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had broughtwith him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ----;and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned,the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from herhusband’s room, crossing the road,immediately running into theother, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy wouldnever have come so soon to wait upon me.”Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the complimentbefore their approach was announced by the door-bell,shortlyafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person andaddress most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had beenused to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usualreserve, to Mrs. Collins;whatever might be his feelings towards herfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merelycourtesied to him, without saying a word.Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with thereadinessease of a well-bred man,talked very pleasantly; buthis cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house andgarden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire ofElizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usualway; and, after a moment’s pause, added,--“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you neverhappened to see her there?”She was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to seewhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between theBingleysJane;she thought he looked a little confused as heanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. Thesubject was pursued no further,the gentlemen soon afterwards wentaway.[Illustration:“”]CHAPTER XXXI.[Illustration]Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure oftheir engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before theyreceived any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in thehouse they could not be necessary;it was not till Easter-day,almost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured bysuch an attention,then they were merely asked on leaving church tocome there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very littleof either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had calledat the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they hadonly seen at church.The invitation was accepted, of course,at a proper hour they joinedthe party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her Ladyship received themcivilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means soacceptable as when she could get nobody else;she was, in fact,almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,much more than to any other person in the room.Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was awelcome relief to him at Rosings;Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had,moreover, caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, andtalked so agreeably of KentHertfordshire, of travellingstayingat home, of  booksmusic, that Elizabeth had never been half sowell entertained in that room before;they conversed with so muchspiritflow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, aswell as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soonrepeatedly turnedtowards them with a look of curiosity;that her Ladyship, after awhile, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did notscruple to call out,--“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talkingof? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”“”when no longer able to avoida reply.“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. Imust have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more trueenjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had everlearnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if herhealth had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would haveperformed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.“” said LadyCatherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,if she does not practise a great deal.”“”“that she does not need such advice.She practises very constantly.”“So much the better. It cannot be done too much;when I next writeto her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I oftentell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired withoutconstant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she willnever play really well, unless she practises more;though Mrs.Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often toldher, to come to Rosings every day,play on the pianoforte in Mrs.Jenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that partof the house.”Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding,madeno answer.When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of havingpromised to play to him;she sat down directly to the instrument. Hedrew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song,thentalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away fromher,moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’scountenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing,at the firstconvenient pause turned to him with an arch smile,said,--“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hearme. But I will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened atthe will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt tointimidate me.”“”“because you couldnot really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you;Ihave had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that youfind great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,are not your own.”Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself,said toColonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion ofme,teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unluckyin meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in apart of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degreeof credit.  Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mentionall that you k to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give meleave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”“”smilingly.“” cried ColonelFitzwilliam. “”“You shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. Thefirst time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was ata ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only fourdances! I am sorry to pain you, but so it was. He danced only fourdances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, morethan one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy,you cannot deny the fact.”“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assemblybeyond my own party.”“True;nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.  ColonelFitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”“” said Darcy, “I should have judged better had I sought anintroduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”“”stilladdressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense andeducation,who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommendhimself to strangers?”“” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying tohim. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”“” said Darcy,“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannotcatch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in theirconcerns, as I often see done.”“”“do not move over this instrument in themasterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the sameforce or rapidity,do not produce the same expression. But then Ihave always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not takethe trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingersas capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”Darcy smiledsaid, “You are perfectly right. You have employed yourtime much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you canthink anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”Here they were interrupted by  who called out to knowwhat they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, saidto Darcy,--“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, andcould have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notionof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would havebeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”Elizabeth looked at Darcy, to see how cordially he assented to hiscousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could shediscern any symptom of love;from the whole of his behaviour to MissDe Bourgh she derived this comfort for  that he might havebeen just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixingwith them many instructions on executiontaste. Elizabeth receivedthem with all the forbearance of civility;at the request of thegentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship’s carriage wasready to take them all home.[Illustration]CHAPTER XXXII.[Illustration]Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning,writing to Jane,while Mrs. CollinsMaria were gone on business into the village,when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of avisitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to beLady Catherine;under that apprehension was putting away herhalf-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,when the door opened,to her very great surprise Mr. Darcy,Mr.Darcy only, entered the room.He seemed astonished too on finding her alone,apologized for hisintrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies tobe within.They then sat down,when her inquiries after Rosings were made,seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutelynecessary, therefore, to think of something;in this emergencyrecollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire,feelingcurious to know what he would say on the subject of their hastydeparture, she observed,--“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see youall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the daybefore. Hehis sisters were well,  when you left London?”“”She found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a shortpause, added,--“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of everreturning to Netherfield again?”“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spendvery little of his time there in future. He has many friends,he isat a time of life when friendsengagements are continuallyincreasing.”“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for theneighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then wemight possibly get a settled family there.  perhaps, Mr. Bingley didnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood asfor his own,we must expect him to keep or quit it on the sameprinciple.”“” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up assoon as any eligible purchase offers.”Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of hisfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave thetrouble of finding a subject to him.He took the hintsoon began with, “This seems a very comfortablehouse.  I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.Collins first came to Hunsford.”“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed herkindness on a more grateful object.”“”“ indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one ofthe very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have madehim happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--thoughI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisestthing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however; and, in aprudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.”“It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy adistance of her own familyfriends.”“”“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’sjourney.  I call it a very easy distance.”“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_of the match,”“I should never have said Mrs. Collinswas settled _near_ her family.”“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyondthe very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied sheunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane andNetherfield,she blushed as she answered,--“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near herfamily. The farthe near must be relative,depend on manyvarying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expense oftravelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not thecase _here_. Mr.Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but notsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded myfriend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_the present distance.”Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her,said, “_You_ cannothave a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot havebeen always at Longbourn.”Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change offeeling; he drew back his chair, took a spaper from the table, and,glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--“”A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either sidecalmconcise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotteand her sister, just returned from their walk. The _tête-à-tête_surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned hisintruding on  and, after sitting a few minutes longer,without saying much to anybody, went away.[Illustration: “”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“” said Charlotte, as soon as he wasgone. “My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would neverhave called on us in this familiar way.”But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after variousconjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed fromthe difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probablefrom the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors therewas  books,a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot bealways within doors;in the nearness of the Parsonage, or thepleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, thetwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thitheralmost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimesseparately, sometimes together,nowthen accompanied by theiraunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because hehad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommendedhim still more;Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction inbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her formerfavourite, George Wickham;though, in comparing them, she saw therewas less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, shebelieved he might have the best informed mind.But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficultto understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat thereten minutes together without opening his lips;when he did speak, itseemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice topropriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared reallyanimated. Mrs. Collins k not what to make of him. ColonelFitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he wasgenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have toldher;as she would have liked to believe this change the effect oflove,the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herselfseriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were atRosings,whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. Hecertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of thatlook was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she oftendoubted whether there were much admiration in it,sometimes itseemed nothing but absence of mind.She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of hisbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea;Mrs.Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger ofraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in heropinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike wouldvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marryingColonel Fitzwilliam. He was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: hecertainly admired her,his situation in life was most eligible; but,to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronagein the church,his cousin could have none at all.[Illustration: “”]CHAPTER XXXIII.[Illustration]More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of themischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, toprevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,therefore, was very odd! Yet it did,even the third. It seemed likewilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it wasnot merely a few formal inquiriesan awkward pausethen away,but he actually thought it necessary to turn backwalk with her. Henever said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talkingor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their thirdrencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about herpleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks,heropinion of Mr.Mrs. Collins’s happiness;that in speaking ofRosings,her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed toexpect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have ColonelFitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he mustmean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed hera little,she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in thepales opposite the Parsonage.She was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane’s lastletter,dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had notwritten in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,she saw, on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.Putting away the letter immediately,forcing a smile, she said,--“”“”“as I generallydo every year,intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage.Are you going much farther?”“ I should have turned in a moment.”And accordingly she did turn,they walked towards the Parsonagetogether.“” said she.“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. Hearranges the business just as he pleases.”“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at leastgreat pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know anybody who seemsmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”“” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it thanmany others, because he is rich,many others are poor. I speakfeelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial anddependence.”“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little ofeither.  seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial anddependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from goingwherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I haveexperienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greaterweight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marrywhere they like.”“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very oftendo.”“Our habits of expense make us too dependent,there are not many inmy rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention tomoney.”“” thought Elizabeth, “”she coloured at theidea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what isthe usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother isvery sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”He answered her in the same style,the subject dropped. To interrupta silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,she soon afterwards said,--“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake ofhaving somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure alasting convenience of that kind.  perhaps, his sister does as wellfor the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what helikes with her.”“” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he mustdivide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”“Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Doesyour charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimesa little difficult to manage;if she has the true Darcy spirit, shemay like to have her own way.”As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly;the mannerin which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely togive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or othergot pretty near the truth. She directly replied,--“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her;I daresay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is avery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst andMiss  I think I have heard you say that you know them.”“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlikeman--he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”“” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.Bingley,takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”“Care of him!  I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him inthose points where he most wants care. From something that he told mein our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebtedto him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to supposethat Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”“”“It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to begenerally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family itwould be an unpleasant thing.”“”“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himselfon having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a mostimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any otherparticulars;I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing himthe kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort,fromknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”“”“I understood that there were some very strong objections against thelady.”“”“” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “Heonly told me what I have now told you.”Elizabeth made no answer,walked on, her heart swelling withindignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why shewas so thoughtful.“”“Yourcousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be thejudge?”“”“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of hisfriend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was todeterminedirect in what manner that friend was to be happy. ”she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of theparticulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposedthat there was much affection in the case.”“” said Fitzwilliam; “but it islessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture ofMr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferentmatters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruptionof all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any otherpeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected. Therecould not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could havesuch boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measurestaken to separate Mr. BingleyJane, she had never doubted; but shehad always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design andarrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,_he_ was the cause--his pridecaprice were the cause--of all thatJane had suffered,still continued to suffer. He had ruined for awhile every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heartin the world;no one could say how lasting an evil he might haveinflicted.“” were ColonelFitzwilliam’s words;these strong objections probably were, herhaving one uncle who was a country attorney,another who was inbusiness in London.“” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility ofobjection,--all lovelinessgoodness as she is! Her understandingexcellent, her mind improved,her manners captivating. Neither couldanything be urged against my father, who, though with somepeculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,and respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thoughtof her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she wouldnot allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound fromthe want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their wantof sense;she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partlygoverned by this worst kind of pride,partly by the wish ofretaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.The agitationtears which the subject occasioned brought on aheadache;it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added toher unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend hercousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go,as muchas possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collinscould not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being ratherdispleased by her staying at home.[Illustration]CHAPTER XXXIV.[Illustration]When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself asmuch as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment theexamination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since herbeing in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there anyrevival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.But in all,in almost every line of each, there was a want of thatcheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style,which,proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself,kindlydisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabethnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with anattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’sshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her akeener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation tothink that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself bewith Jane again,enabled to contribute to the recovery of herspirits, by all that affection could do.She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that hiscousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clearthat he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did notmean to be unhappy about him.While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of thedoor-bell;her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of itsbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late inthe evening,might now come to inquire particularly after her. Butthis idea was soon banished,her spirits were very differentlyaffected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into theroom. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after herhealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, andthen getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, butsaid not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards herin an agitated manner,thus began:--“In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not berepressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admireloveyou.”Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,doubted,was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,and the avowal of all that he felthad long felt for her immediatelyfollowed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of theheart to be detailed,he was not more eloquent on the subject oftenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being adegradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposedto inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to theconsequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend hissuit.In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible tothe compliment of such a man’s affection,though her intentions didnot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was toreceive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lostall compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself toanswer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded withrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which in spite ofall his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer;withexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance ofhis hand. As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of afavourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehensionanxiety, but hiscountenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could onlyexasperate farther;when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeksand she said,--“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode toexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, howeverunequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should befelt,if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But Icannot--I have never desired your good opinion,you have certainlybestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain toanyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however,I hope will beof short duration. The feelings which you tell me have long preventedthe acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty inovercoming it after this explanation.”Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixedon her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment thansurprise. His complexion became pale with anger,the disturbance ofhis mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for theappearance of composure,would not open his lips till he believedhimself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelingsdreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! Imight, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ atcivility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”“” replied she, “why, with so evident a designof offendinginsulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked meagainst your will, against your reason,even against your character?Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I haveother provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decidedagainst you, had they been indifferent, or had they even beenfavourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to acceptthe man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, thehappiness of a most beloved sister?”As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotionwas short,he listened without attempting to interrupt her while shecontinued,--“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive canexcuse the unjustungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only meansof dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of theworld for capriceinstability, the other to its derision fordisappointed hopes,involving them both in misery of the acutestkind.”She paused,saw with no slight indignation that he was listeningwith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.“” she repeated.With assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denyingthat I did everything in my power to separate my friend from yoursister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have beenkinder than towards myself.”Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.“”“on which my dislikeis founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you wasdecided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I receivedmany months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have tosay? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”“” said Darcy,in a less tranquil tone,with a heightened colour.“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling aninterest in him?”“” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, hismisfortunes have been great indeed.”“”with energy; “You havereduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. Youhave withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designedfor him. You have deprived the best years of his life of thatindependence which was no less his due than his desert. You have doneall this!yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes withcontemptridicule.”“” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! Ithank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to thiscalculation, are heavy indeed!  perhaps,” added he, stopping in hiswalk,turning towards her, “these offences might have beenoverlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of thescruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. Thesebitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greaterpolicy, concealed my struggles,flattered you into the belief of mybeing impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, byreflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were naturaljust.Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of yourconnections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whosecondition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried tothe utmost to speak with composure when she said,--“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of yourdeclaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me theconcern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in amore gentlemanlike manner.”She saw him start at this; but he said nothing,she continued,--“You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible waythat would have tempted me to accept it.”Again his astonishment was obvious;he looked at her with anexpression of mingled incredulitymortification. She went on,--“From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of myacquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullestbelief of your arrogance, your conceit,your selfish disdain of thefeelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork ofdisapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable adislike;I had not known you a month before I felt that you were thelast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend yourfeelings,have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time,accept my bestwishes for your healthhappiness.”And with these words he hastily left the room,Elizabeth heard himthe next moment open the front doorquit the house. The tumult ofher mind was now painfully great. She k not how to support herself,and, from actual weakness, sat downcried for half an hour. Herastonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased byevery review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from that he should have been in love with her for so many months!so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objectionswhich had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister,whichmust appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almostincredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strongan affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowalof what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance inacknowledging, though he could not justify it,the unfeeling mannerwhich he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had notattempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of hisattachment had for a moment excited.She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of LadyCatherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounterCharlotte’s observation,hurried her away to her room.[Illustration:“”]CHAPTER XXXV.[Illustration]Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughtsmeditationswhich had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from thesurprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anythingelse; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon afterbreakfast to indulge herself in airexercise. She was proceedingdirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’ssometimes coming there stopped her,instead of entering the park,she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. Thepark paling was still the boundary on one side,she soon passed oneof the gates into the ground.After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she wastempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates andlook into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent hadmade a great difference in the country,every day was adding to theverdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing herwalk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grovewhich edged the park: he was moving that way;fearful of its beingMr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced wasnow near enough to see her,stepping forward with eagerness,pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved againtowards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding outa letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughtycomposure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope ofmeeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” andthen, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation,was soonout of sight.With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,Elizabeth opened the letter,to her still increasing wonder,perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, writtenquite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewisefull. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was datedfrom Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning,was as follows:--“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension ofits containing any repetition of those sentiments, or real of thoseoffers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without anyintention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten;theeffort which the formationthe perusal of this letter must occasion,should have been spared, had not my character required it to be writtenand read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demandyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but Idemand it of your justice.“Two offences of a very different nature,by no means of equalmagnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingleyfrom your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of variousclaims, in defiance of honourhumanity, ruined the immediateprosperityblasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully andwantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledgedfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any otherdependence than on our patronage,who had been brought up to expectits exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two youngpersons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, couldbear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was lastnight so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hopeto be in future secured, when the following account of my actions andtheir motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is dueto myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may beoffensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity mustbe obeyed,further apology would be absurd. I had not been long inHertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingleypreferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. Butit was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had anyapprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen himin love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing withyou, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidentalinformation, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise toa general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certainevent, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment Iobserved my friend’s behaviour attentively;I could then perceivethat his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessedin him. Your sister I also watched. Her lookmanners were open,cheerful,engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiarregard;I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, thatthough she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invitethem by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistakenhere, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of yoursister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misledby such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not beenunreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity ofyour sister’s countenanceair was such as might have given the mostacute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heartwas not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believingher indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that myinvestigationsdecisions are not usually influenced by my hopes orfears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; Ibelieved it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last nightacknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put asidein my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil tomy friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causeswhich, though still existing,existing to an equal degree in bothinstances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were notimmediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. Thesituation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing incomparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almostuniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, andoccasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offendyou. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give youconsolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoidany share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed onyouyour eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense anddisposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passedthat evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed,everyinducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve myfriend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He leftNetherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,remember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted isnow to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excitedwith my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alikesensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, weshortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordinglywent--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to myfriend the certain evils of such a choice. I describedenforced themearnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayedhis determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately haveprevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, whichI hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had beforebelieved her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a strongerdependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuadehim against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had beengiven, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself forhaving done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the wholeaffair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that Icondescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from himyour sister’s being in town. I k it myself, as it was known to MissBingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they mighthave met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regarddid not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without somedanger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It isdone, however,it was done for the best. On this subject I havenothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded yoursister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done;though the motives whichgoverned me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have notyet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weightyaccusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it bylaying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what hehas _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what Ishall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many yearsthe management of all the Pemberley estates,whose good conduct inthe discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of serviceto him;on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness wastherefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, andafterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable togive him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of thisyoung man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also thehighest opinion of him,hoping the church would be his profession,intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many yearssince I first began to think of him in a very different manner. Thevicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful toguard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape theobservation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,whohad opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcycould not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree youonly can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham hascreated, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfoldinghis real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent fatherdied about five years ago;his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to thelast so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me topromote his advancement in the best manner that his profession mightallow,if he took orders, desired that a valuable family livingmight be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy ofone thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; andwithin half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform methat, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I shouldnot think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediatepecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not bebenefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,Imust be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a veryinsufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to besincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to hisproposal. I k that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. Thebusiness was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistancein the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation toreceive it,accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connectionbetween us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite himto Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, hechiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence;beingnow free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness anddissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on thedecease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. Hiscircumstances, he assured me,I had no difficulty in believing it,were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would presenthim to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be littledoubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You willhardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or forresisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion tothe distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent inhis abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After thisperiod, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, Iknow not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on mynotice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forgetmyself,which no obligation less than the present should induce meto unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt ofyour secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was leftto the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, andmyself. About a year ago, she was taken from school,anestablishment formed for her in London;last summer she went withthe lady who presided over it to Ramsgate;thither also went Mr.Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prioracquaintance between himMrs. Younge, in whose character we weremost unhappily deceived;by her connivanceaid he so farrecommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained astrong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she waspersuaded to believe herself in loveto consent to an elopement. Shewas then but fifteen, which must be her excuse;after stating herimprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it toherself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intendedelopement;then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grievingand offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felthow Iacted. Regard for my sister’s creditfeelings prevented any publicexposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’schief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirtythousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenginghimself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have beencomplete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event inwhich we have been concerned together;if you do not absolutelyreject it as false, you will,  acquit me henceforth of crueltytowards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form offalsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to bewondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerningeither. Detection could not be in your power,suspicion certainlynot in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was nottold you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to knowwhat could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything hererelated, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of ColonelFitzwilliam, who, from our near relationshipconstant intimacy, andstill more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has beenunavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. Ifyour abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, youcannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; andthat there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavourto find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in thecourse of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.“”[Illustration]CHAPTER XXXVI.[Illustration]Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it tocontain a real of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all ofits contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerlyshe went through them,what a contrariety of emotion they excited.Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement didshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation togive, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strongprejudice against everything he might say, she began his account ofwhat had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness whichhardly left her power of comprehension;from impatience of knowingwhat the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to thesense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’sinsensibility she instantly resolved to be false;his account of thereal, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have anywish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had donewhich satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was allprideinsolence.But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--whenshe read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth,whichbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelingswere yet more acutely painfulmore difficult of definition.Astonishment, apprehension,even horror, oppressed her. She wishedto discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she hadgone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of thelast page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would notregard it, that she would never look in it again.In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest onnothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letterwas unfolded again;collecting herself as well as she could, sheagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, andcommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactlywhat he had related himself;the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with hisown words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came tothe will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the livingwas fresh in her memory;as she recalled his very words, it wasimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or theother, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes didnot err. But when she readre-read, with the closest attention, theparticulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensionsto the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as threethousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down theletter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to beimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but withlittle success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she hadbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as torender Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of aturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.The extravagancegeneral profligacy which he scrupled not to lay toMr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she couldbring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before hisentrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at thepersuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,had there reed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told[Illustration:     “”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power,she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, andmanner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguishedtrait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from theattacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atonefor those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class whatMr. Darcy had described as the idlenessvice of many years’continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see himinstantly before her, in every charm of airaddress, but she couldremember no more substantial good than the general approbation of theneighbourhood,the regard which his social powers had gained him inthe mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she oncemore continued to read.  alas! the story which followed, of hisdesigns on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passedbetween Colonel Fitzwilliamherself only the morning before;atlast she was referred for the truth of every particular to ColonelFitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received theinformation of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairswhosecharacter she had no reason to question. At one time she had almostresolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardnessof the application,at length wholly banished by the conviction thatMr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not beenwell assured of his cousin’s corroboration.She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversationbetween Wickhamherself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_struck with the  of such communications to a stranger, andwondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of puttinghimself forward as he had done,the inconsistency of his professionswith his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fearof seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ballthe very next week. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfieldfamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one butherself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’scharacter, though he had assured her that respect for the father wouldalways prevent his exposing the son.How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! Hisattentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely andhatefully mercenary;the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longerthe moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he hadeither been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifyinghis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had mostincautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainterand fainter;in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could notbut allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long agoasserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proudrepulsive aswere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of theiracquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them muchtogether,given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anythingthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke himof irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he wasesteemedvalued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as abrother,that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of hissister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had hisactions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation ofeverything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; andthat friendship between a person capable of itsuch an amiable manas Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickhamcould she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,prejudiced, absurd.“”“I, who have prided myself onmy discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who haveoften disdained the generous candour of my sister,gratified myvanity in useless or blameless distrust. How humiliating is thisdiscovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could nothave been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been myfolly. Pleased with the preference of one,offended by the neglectof the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courtedprepossessionignorance,driven reason away where either wereconcerned. Till this moment, I never k myself.”From herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a linewhich soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation_there_ had appeared very insufficient;she read it again. Widelydifferent was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny thatcredit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged togive in the other? He declared himself to have been totally unsuspiciousof her sister’s attachment;she could not help remembering whatCharlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justiceof his description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, thoughfervent, were little displayed,that there was a constantcomplacency in her airmanner, not often united with greatsensibility.When she came to that part of the letter in which her family werementioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her senseof shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forciblyfor denial;the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, ashaving passed at the Netherfield ball,as confirming all his firstdisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mindthan on hers.The compliment to herselfher sister was not unfelt. It soothed, butit could not console her for the contempt which had been thusself-attracted by the rest of her family;as she considered thatJane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearestrelations,reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurtby such  of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything shehad ever known before.After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to everyvariety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, andreconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so suddensoimportant, fatigue,a recollection of her long absence, made her atlength return home;she entered the house with the wish of appearingcheerful as usual,the resolution of repressing such reflections asmust make her unfit for conversation.She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had eachcalled during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to takeleave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at leastan hour, hoping for her return,almost resolving to walk after hertill she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern inmissing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was nolonger an object. She could think only of her letter.[Illustration:“”]CHAPTER XXXVII.[Illustration]The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning;Mr. Collins havingbeen in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, wasable to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in verygood health,in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after themelancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he thenhastened to console Lady Catherineher daughter;on his returnbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous ofhaving them all to dine with her.Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, hadshe chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as herfuture niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what herLadyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she have said? howwould she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amusedherself.Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings’ party. “I assureyou, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe nobodyfeels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularlyattached to these young men;know them to be so much attached to me!They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dearColonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcyseemed to feel it most acutely--more, I think, than last year. Hisattachment to Rosings certainly increases.”Mr. Collins had a complimentan allusion to throw in here, whichwere kindly smiled on by the motherdaughter.Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out ofspirits;immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing thatshe did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that youmay stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of yourcompany, I am sure.”“” repliedElizabeth; “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in townnext Saturday.”“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expectedyou to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. Therecan be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainlyspare you for another fortnight.”“”[Illustration:“”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“ your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you willstay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of youas far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; andas  does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very goodroom for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to becool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of yoularge.”“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by ouroriginal plan.”Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servantwith them. You know I always speak my mind,I cannot bear the ideaof two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in theworld to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properlyguardedattended, according to their situation in life. When myniece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of herhaving two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.Darcy of Pemberley,Lady Anne, could not have appeared withpropriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all thosethings. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I amglad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really bediscreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”“”“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad youhave somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change horses? Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will beattended to.”Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey;and as she did not answer them all herself attention wasnecessary--which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with amind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflectionmust be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gaveway to it as the greatest relief;not a day went by without asolitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight ofunpleasant recollections.Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. Shestudied every sentence;her feelings towards its writer were attimes widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustlyshe had condemnedupbraided him, her anger was turned againstherself;his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but shecould not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, orfeel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own pastbehaviour, there was a constant source of vexationregret:inthe unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing atthem, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of hisyoungest daughters;her mother, with manners so far from rightherself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequentlyunited with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherineand Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,irritable,completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been alwaysaffronted by their advice;Lydia, self-willedcareless, wouldscarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle,vain. Whilethere was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him;whileMeryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there forever.Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern;Mr. Darcy’sexplanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved tohave been sincere,his conduct cleared of all blame, unless anycould attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. Howgrievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in everyrespect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane hadbeen deprived, by the follyindecorum of her own family!When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’scharacter, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which hadseldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make italmost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week ofher stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spentthere;her Ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars oftheir journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only rightway, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all thework of the morning,pack her trunk afresh.When they parted,  with great condescension, wished thema good journey,invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesyhold outher hand to both.[Illustration:“.”]CHAPTER XXXVIII.[Illustration]On Saturday morning ElizabethMr. Collins met for breakfast a fewminutes before the others appeared;he took the opportunity ofpaying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.“”“whether Mrs. Collins has yetexpressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am verycertain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks forit. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We knowhow little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plainmanner of living, our small rooms,few domestics,the little wesee of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady likeyourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spendingyour time unpleasantly.”Elizabeth was eager with her thanksassurances of happiness. She hadspent six weeks with great enjoyment;the pleasure of being withCharlotte,the kind attention she had received, must make _her_ feelthe obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified;with a more smilingsolemnity replied,--“It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed yourtime not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best;mostfortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superiorsociety,from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means ofvarying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves thatyour Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situationwith regard to Lady Catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort ofextraordinary advantageblessing which few can boast. You see onwhat a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. Intruth, I must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of thishumble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object ofcompassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings;he wasobliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civilityand truth in a few short sentences.“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us intoHertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself, at least, that you willbe able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins youhave been a daily witness of;altogether I trust it does not appearthat your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will beas well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity inmarriage. My dear CharlotteI have but one mindone way ofthinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance ofcharacterideas between us. We seem to have been designed for eachother.”Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that wasthe case,with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believedand rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, tohave the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady fromwhom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to suchsociety! But she had chosen it with her eyes open;though evidentlyregretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask forcompassion. Her homeher housekeeping, her parishher poultry,and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcelsplaced within,it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionateparting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage byMr. Collins;as they walked down the garden, he was commissioningher with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanksfor the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter,hiscompliments to Mr.Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handedher in, Maria followed,the door was on the point of being closed,when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they hadhitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.[Illustration:“”]“” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respectsdelivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to youwhile you have been here.”Elizabeth made no objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, andthe carriage drove off.“” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seemsbut a day or two since we first came!yet how many things havehappened!”“” said her companion, with a sigh.“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!How much I shall have to tell!”Elizabeth privately added, “”Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; andwithin four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner’shouse, where they were to remain a few days.Jane looked well,Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying herspirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunthad reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her,atLongbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even forLongbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To knowthat she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonishJane,must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her ownvanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptationto openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecisionin which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate,and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried intorepeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sisterfurther.[Illustration:     “”]CHAPTER XXXIX.[Illustration]It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set outtogether from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage wasto meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’spunctuality, both KittyLydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employedin visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, anddressing a saladcucumber.After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table setout with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,“”“” added Lydia; “but you must lend us themoney, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then showingher purchases,--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think itis very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shallpull it to pieces as soon as I get home,see if I can make it up anybetter.”And when her sisters abused it as ugly,with perfectunconcern, “ but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; andwhen I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, Ithink it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify whatone wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton,theyare going in a fortnight.”“”with the greatest satisfaction.“They are going to be encamped near Brighton;I do so want papa totake us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like togo, too, of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shallhave!”“” thought Elizabeth; “_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brightona wholecampful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poorregiment of militia,the monthly balls of Meryton!”“Now I have got some s for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down totable. “What do you think? It is excellent s, capital s,abouta certain person that we all like.”JaneElizabeth looked at each other,the waiter was told that heneed not stay. Lydia laughed,said,--“Ay, that is just like your formalitydiscretion. You thought thewaiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worsethings said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am gladhe is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life.  but now formy s: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?There is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King--there’s for you! Sheis gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”“” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connectionimprudent as to fortune.”“”“” said Jane.“I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never caredthree straws about her. Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckledthing?”Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of suchcoarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_was little other than her own breast had formerly harbouredfanciedliberal!As soon as all had ate,the elder ones paid, the carriage wasordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all theirboxes, workbags,parcels,the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s andLydia’s purchases, were seated in it.“” cried Lydia. “I am glad I brought mybonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box!  nowlet us be quite comfortablesnug,talklaugh all the wayhome. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you allsince you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had anyflirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husbandbefore you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord! how ashamed I should be of notbeing married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so toget husbands you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!how I should like to be married before any of you!then I would_chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good pieceof fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s! Kittyme were to spendthe day there,Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in theevening; (by-the-bye, Mrs. Forsterme are _such_ friends!)soshe asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill,so Penwas forced to come by herself;then, what do you think we did? Wedressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for alady,--only think what fun! Not a soul k of it, but ColonelMrs.Forster,Kittyme, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrowone of her gowns;you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,and Wickham,Pratt,two or three more of the men came in, theydid not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed!so did Mrs.Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspectsomething,then they soon found out what was the matter.”With such kind of histories of their partiesgood jokes did Lydia,assisted by Kitty’s hintsadditions, endeavour to amuse hercompanions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as shecould, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Janein undiminished beauty;more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennetsay voluntarily to Elizabeth,----“”Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucasescame to meet Mariahear the s;various were the subjectswhich occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across thetable, after the welfarepoultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennetwas doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the presentfashions from Jane, who sat some way below her,on the other,retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases;Lydia, in a voicerather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the variouspleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.“ Mary,”“I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!as we went along Kittyme drew up all the blinds,pretendedthere was nobody in the coach;I should have gone so all the way, ifKitty had not been sick;when we got to the George, I do think webehaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicestcold luncheon in the world,if you would have gone, we would havetreated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thoughtwe never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.And then we were so merry all the way home! we talkedlaughed soloud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”To this, Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,to depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with thegenerality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for_me_. I should infinitely prefer a book.”But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened toanybody for more than half a minute,never attended to Mary at all.In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk toMeryton,see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposedthe scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be athome half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There wasanother reason, too, for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickhamagain,was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to_her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyondexpression. In a fortnight they were to go,once gone, she hopedthere could be nothing more to plague her on his account.She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brightonscheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was underfrequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that herfather had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers wereat the same time so vagueequivocal, that her mother, though oftendisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.[Illustration]CHAPTER XL.[Illustration]Elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could nolonger be overcome;at length resolving to suppress every particularin which her sister was concerned,preparing her to be surprised,she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.Darcyherself.Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterlypartiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectlynatural;all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She wassorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner solittle suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for theunhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.“”“and certainlyought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase hisdisappointment.”“” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he hasother feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”“Blame you!  no.”“”“”“But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the verynext day.”She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as faras they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane,who would willingly have gone through the world without believing thatso much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was herecollected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, thoughgrateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, andseek to clear one, without involving the other.“”“you never will be able to make bothof them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfiedwith only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; justenough to make one good sort of man;of late it has been shiftingabout pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.Darcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.“”“Wickham sovery bad! It is almost past belief. And poor  dear only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! andwith the knowledge of your ill opinion too!having to relate such athing of his sister! It is really too distressing, I am sure you mustfeel it so.”“Oh no, my regretcompassion are all done away by seeing you so fullof both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growingevery moment more unconcernedindifferent. Your profusion makes mesaving;if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be aslight as a feather.”“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in hiscountenance! such an opennessgentleness in his manner.”“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of thosetwo young men. One has got all the goodness,the other all theappearance of it.”“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as youused to do.”“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a disliketo him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such anopening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continuallyabusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughingat a man without nowthen stumbling on something witty.”“ when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treatthe matter as you do now.”“ I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I was veryuncomfortable--I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what Ifelt, no Jane to comfort me,say that I had not been so very weak,and vain,nonsensical, as I k I had!  how I wanted you!”“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressionsin speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear whollyundeserved.”“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a mostnatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There isone point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether Iought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understandWickham’s character.”Miss Bennet paused a little,then replied, “Surely there can be nooccasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?”“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorized me tomake his communication public. On the contrary, every particularrelative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible tomyself;if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of hisconduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy isso violent, that it would be the death of half the good people inMeryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal toit. Wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify toanybody here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all foundout,then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.At present I will say nothing about it.”“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him forever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done,anxious tore-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. Shehad got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for afortnight,was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever shemight wish to talk again of either. But there was still somethinglurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared notrelate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sisterhow sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge inwhich no one could partake;she was sensible that nothing less thana perfect understanding between the parties could justify her inthrowing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “”“ifthat very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely beable to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable mannerhimself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lostall its value!”She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the realstate of her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished avery tender affection for  Having never even fancied herself inlove before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,fromher agedisposition, greater steadiness than first attachments oftenboast;so fervently did she value his remembrance,prefer him toevery other man, that all her good sense,all her attention to thefeelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of thoseregrets which must have been injurious to her own healththeirtranquillity.“ ”one day, “what is your opinion _now_ ofthis sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined never to speakof it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But Icannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London.  he is avery undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the leastchance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of hiscoming to Netherfield again in the summer;I have inquired ofeverybody, too, who is likely to know.”[Illustration:     “”]“”“ well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come; though Ishall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and, if I washer, I would not have put up with it.  my comfort is, I am sureJane will die of a broken heart,then he will be sorry for what hehas done.”But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation shemade no answer.“ ” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so theCollinses live very comfortable, do they?  well, I only hope itwill last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is anexcellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother,she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_housekeeping, I dare say.”“ nothing at all.”“A great deal of good management, depend upon it.  yes. _They_ willtake care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressedfor money.  much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they oftentalk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon itquite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”“”“No; it would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt theyoften talk of it between themselves.  if they can be easy with anestate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _I_ should beashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”[Illustration:“”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER XLI.[Illustration]The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It wasthe last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton,all the young ladies inthe neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almostuniversal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,and sleep,pursue the usual course of their employments. Veryfrequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty andLydia, whose own misery was extreme,who could not comprehend suchhard-heartedness in any of the family.“” would theyoften exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,Lizzy?”Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered whatshe had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.“”“I cried for two days together when ColonelMiller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart.”“” said Lydia.“” observed Mrs. Bennet.“”“”“”added Kitty.Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually throughLongbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all senseof pleasure was lost in shame. She felt a the justice of Mr. Darcy’sobjections;never had she before been so much disposed to pardon hisinterference in the views of his friend.But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for shereceived an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of theregiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was avery young woman,very lately married. A resemblance in good-humourand good spirits had recommended herLydia to each other,out oftheir _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,the delight of Mrs. Bennet,the mortification of Kitty, are scarcelyto be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flewabout the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’scongratulations,laughingtalking with more violence than ever;whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fatein terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.“”said she, “though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as muchright to be asked as she has,more too, for I am two years older.”In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable,Jane to makeher resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far fromexciting in her the same feelings as in her motherLydia, that sheconsidered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sensefor the latter;detestable as such a step must make her, were itknown, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let hergo. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s generalbehaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship ofsuch a woman as Mrs. Forster,the probability of her being yet moreimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations mustbe greater than at home. He heard her attentively,then said,--“Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some publicplace or other,we can never expect her to do it with so littleexpense or inconvenience to her family as under the presentcircumstances.”“”“of the very great disadvantage tous all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded andimprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure youwould judge differently in the affair.”“” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What! has she frightened awaysome of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Suchsqueamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdityare not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellowswho have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”“ you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is notof peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Ourimportance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by thewild volatility, the assurancedisdain of all restraint which markLydia’s character. Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dearfather, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, andof teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business ofher life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her characterwill be fixed;she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirtthat ever made herselfher family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in theworstmeanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyondyoutha tolerable person; and, from the ignoranceemptiness ofher mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universalcontempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kittyis also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,ignorant, idle,absolutely uncontrolled!  my dear father, can yousuppose it possible that they will not be censureddespised whereverthey are known,that their sisters will not be often involved in thedisgrace?”Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and,affectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,--“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever youJane are known,you must be respectedvalued;you will not appear to lessadvantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very sillysisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go toBrighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man,willkeep her out of any real mischief;she is luckily too poor to be anobject of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importanceeven as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will findwomen better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her beingthere may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot growmany degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the restof her life.”With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinioncontinued the same,she left him disappointedsorry. It was notin her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.She was confident of having performed her duty;to fret overunavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of herdisposition.Had Lydiaher mother known the substance of her conference with herfather, their indignation would hardly have found expression in theirunited volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprisedevery possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eyeof fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.She saw herself the object of attention to tensto scores of them atpresent unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp: its tentsstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the youngand the gay,dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, shesaw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least sixofficers at once.[Illustration:“”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects andsuch realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They couldhave been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly thesame. Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for themelancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go therehimself.But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed;their rapturescontinued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leavinghome.Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having beenfrequently in company with him since her return, agitation was prettywell over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had evenlearnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,an affectationa sameness to disgustweary. In his presentbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;for the inclination he soon testified of reing those attentions whichhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, afterwhat had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him infinding herself thus selected as the object of such idlefrivolousgallantry;while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel thereproof contained in his believing, that however long,for whatevercause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,and her preference secured, at any time, by their real.On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined,with others of the officers, at Longbourn;so little was Elizabethdisposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making someinquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, shementioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’sMr. Darcy’s having both spent threeweeks at Rosings,asked him if he were acquainted with the former.He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment’srecollection,a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seenhim often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.With an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “How long did yousay that he was at Rosings?”“”“”“ almost every day.”“”“ very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.”“” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her. “And praymay I ask--” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it inaddress that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to hisordinary style? for I dare not hope,” he continued, in a lowermoreserious tone, “”“ no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very muchwhat he ever was.”While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether torejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. There was asomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensiveand anxious attention, while she added,--“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean thateither his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that,from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexionagitatedlook; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off hisembarrassment, he turned to her again,said in the gentlest ofaccents,--“You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readilycomprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assumeeven the _appearance_ of what is right.  in that direction,may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deterhim from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear thatthe sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, ismerely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion andjudgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, Iknow, when they were together;a good deal is to be imputed to hiswish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain hehas very much at heart.”Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by aslight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her onthe old subject of his grievances,she was in no humour to indulgehim. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguishElizabeth;they parted at last with mutual civility,possibly amutual desire of never meeting again.When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separationbetween herher family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was theonly one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexationenvy. Mrs.Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss theopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which therewas every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamoroushappiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieusof her sisters were uttered without being heard.[Illustration:The arrival of theGardiners]CHAPTER XLII.[Illustration]Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she couldnot have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domesticcomfort. Her father, captivated by youthbeauty,that appearanceof good-humour which youthbeauty generally give, had married awoman whose weak understandingilliberal mind had very early intheir marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,esteem,confidence had vanished for ever;all his views ofdomestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of adisposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his ownimprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too oftenconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond ofthe countryof books;from these tastes had arisen his principalenjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than asher ignorancefolly had contributed to his amusement. This is notthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to hiswife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the truephilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the  of herfather’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; butrespecting his abilities,grateful for his affectionate treatment ofherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook,tobanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligationand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her ownchildren, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt sostrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of sounsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arisingfrom so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, evenif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found littleother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their partiesabroad were less varied than before;at home she had a mother andsister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything aroundthem threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kittymight in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbersof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose dispositiongreater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all herfollyassurance, by a situation of such double danger as awatering-placea camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, whathas been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had lookedforward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all thesatisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary toname some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to havesome other point on which her wisheshopes might be fixed,byagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for thepresent,prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakeswas now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolationfor all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her motherand Kitty made inevitable;could she have included Jane in thescheme, every part of it would have been perfect.“” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in mysister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations ofpleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight cannever be successful;general disappointment is only warded off bythe defence of some little peculiar vexation.”When Lydia went away she promised to write very oftenvery minutelyto her motherKitty; but her letters were always long expected, andalways very short. Those to her mother contained little else than thatthey were just returned from the library, where suchsuch officershad attended them,where she had seen such beautiful ornaments asmade her quite wild; that she had a  gown, or a  parasol, whichshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in aviolent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her,they were going to thecamp;from her correspondence with her sister there was still lessto be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were muchtoo full of lines under the words to be made public.After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,good-humour,cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everythingwore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the wintercame back again,summer finerysummer engagements arose. Mrs.Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity;by the middleof June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Merytonwithout tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabethhope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerablyreasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, bysome cruelmalicious arrangement at the War Office, another regimentshould be quartered in Meryton.The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fastapproaching;a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letterarrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement andcurtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business fromsetting out till a fortnight later in July,must be in London againwithin a month;as that left too short a period for them to go sofar,see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it withthe leisurecomfort they had built on, they were obliged to give upthe Lakes,substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to thepresent plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In thatcounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their threeweeks;to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. Thetown where she had formerly passed some years of her life,wherethey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object ofher curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,Dovedale, or the Peak.Elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeingthe Lakes;still thought there might have been time enough. But itwas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;and all was soon right again.With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It wasimpossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberleyitsowner. “”“I may enter his county with impunity,and rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass awaybefore her uncleaunt’s arrival. But they did pass away,Mr. andMrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear atLongbourn. The children, two girls of sixeight years old,twoyounger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousinJane, who was the general favourite,whose steady sense andsweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in everyway--teaching them, playing with them,loving them.The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn,set off the nextmorning with Elizabeth in pursuit of noveltyamusement. Oneenjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; asuitableness which comprehended healthtemper to bearinconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affectionand intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there weredisappointments abroad.It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thitherlay--Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc., aresufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the presentconcern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’sformer residence,where she had lately learned that someacquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seenall the principal wonders of the country;within five miles ofLambton, Elizabeth found, from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. Itwas not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. Intalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed aninclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared hiswillingness,Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard somuch?” said her aunt. “A place, too, with which so many of youracquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, youknow.”Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business atPemberley,was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. Shemust own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine houserichly furnished,”“I should not care about it myself; but thegrounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in thecountry.”Elizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. Thepossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantlyoccurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; andthought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run sucha risk. But against this there were objections;she finally resolvedthat it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to theabsence of the family were unfavourably answered.Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaidwhether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of itsproprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down forthe summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question;heralarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal ofcuriosity to see the house herself;when the subject was revived thenext morning,she was again applied to, could readily answer, andwith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any disliketo the scheme.To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.[Illustration:     “”]CHAPTER XLIII.[Illustration]Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance ofPemberley Woods with some perturbation;when at length they turnedin at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.The park was very large,contained great variety of ground. Theyentered it in one of its lowest points,drove for some time througha beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she sawadmiredevery remarkable spotpoint of view. They gradually ascended forhalf a mile,then found themselves at the top of a considerableeminence, where the wood ceased,the eye was instantly caught byPemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into whichthe road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stonebuilding, standing well on rising ground,backed by a ridge of highwoody hills;in front a stream of some natural importance wasswelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its bankswere neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. Shehad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where naturalbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They wereall of them warm in their admiration;at that moment she felt thatto be mistress of Pemberley might be something!They descended the hill, crossed the bridge,drove to the door; and,while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension ofmeeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had beenmistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into thehall;Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure towonder at her being where she was.The housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much lessfine,more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. Theyfollowed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportionedroom, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, wentto a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, fromwhich they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from thedistance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground wasgood;she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scatteredon its banks,the winding of the valley, as far as she could traceit, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects weretaking different positions; but from every window there were beautiesto be seen. The rooms were loftyhandsome,their furnituresuitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, withadmiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselesslyfine,--with less of splendour,more real elegance, than thefurniture of Rosings.“” thought she, “I might have been mistress! Withthese rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead ofviewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, andwelcomed to them as visitors my uncleaunt.  no,” recollectingherself, “that could never be; my uncleaunt would have been lost tome; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were reallyabsent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question wasasked by her uncle;she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynoldsreplied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a largeparty of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey hadnot by any circumstance been delayed a day!Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached,sawthe likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several otherminiatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, howshe liked it. The housekeeper came forward,told them it was thepicture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, whohad been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into thearmy,” she added; “”Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could notreturn it.“” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as theother--about eight years ago.”“” said Mrs. Gardiner,looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face.   you can tellus whether it is like or not.”Mrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on thisintimation of her knowing her master.“”Elizabeth coloured,said, “”“”“ very handsome.”“I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs youwill see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my latemaster’s favourite room,these miniatures are just as they used tobe then. He was very fond of them.”This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawnwhen she was only eight years old.“” said Mr. Gardiner.“ yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen;soaccomplished! She playssings all day long. In the next room is a instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: shecomes here to-morrow with him.”Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easypleasant, encouraged hercommunicativeness by his questionsremarks: Mrs. Reynolds, eitherfrom pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of hermasterhis sister.“”“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half histime here;Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”“” thought Elizabeth, “”“”“ sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who isgood enough for him.”Mr.Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It isvery much to his credit,  that you should think so.”“I say no more than the truth,what everybody will say that knowshim,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,“I have never had a cross word from him in my life,I have known himever since he was four years old.”This was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to herideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.Her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more;wasgrateful to her uncle for saying,--“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky inhaving such a master.”“ sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could notmeet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who aregood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up;hewas always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in theworld.”Elizabeth almost stared at her. “” thought she.“” said Mrs. Gardiner.“ ma’am, that he was indeed;his son will be just like him--justas affable to the poor.”Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted,was impatient for more. Mrs.Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjectsof the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms,the price of thefurniture in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of familyprejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of hermaster, soon led again to the subject;she dwelt with energy on hismany merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.“He is the best landlord,the best master,”“that everlived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing butthemselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what willgive him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I neversaw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattleaway like other young men.”“” thought Elizabeth.“” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is notquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”“”“”On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very prettysitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegancelightness thanthe apartments below;were informed that it was but just done togive pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, whenlast at Pemberley.“”as she walked towardsone of the windows.Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enterthe room. “” she added. “Whatevercan give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. Thereis nothing he would not do for her.”The picture gallery,two or three of the principal bed-rooms, wereall that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings:but Elizabeth k nothing of the art;from such as had been alreadyvisible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of MissDarcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, andalso more intelligible.In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could havelittle to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in questof the only face whose features would be known to her. At last itarrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, withsuch a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, inearnest contemplation,returned to it again before they quitted thegallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in hisfather’s lifetime.There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentlesensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height oftheir acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynoldswas of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praiseof an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, sheconsidered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! Howmuch of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! How much of goodor evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward bythe housekeeper was favourable to his character;as she stood beforethe canvas, on which he was represented,fixed his eyes uponherself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitudethan it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth,softenedits  of expression.When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,they returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, wereconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned backto look again; her uncleaunt stopped also;while the former wasconjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himselfsuddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.They were within twenty yards of each other;so abrupt was hisappearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyesinstantly met,the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepestblush. He absolutely started,for a moment seemed immovable fromsurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at leastof perfect civility.She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to beovercome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picturethey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other twothat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, onbeholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a littlealoof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonishedconfused,scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face,k not what answer shereturned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at thealteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that heuttered was increasing her embarrassment;every idea of the of her being found there recurring to her mind, the fewminutes in which they continued together were some of the mostuncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when hespoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness;he repeated hisinquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn,of her stayin Derbyshire, so often,in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke thedistraction of his thoughts.At length, every idea seemed to fail him;after standing a fewmoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself,tookleave.The others then joined her,expressed their admiration of hisfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her ownfeelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame andvexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judgedthing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what adisgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as ifshe had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they beenonly ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of hisdiscrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, thatmoment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again andagain over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, sostrikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak toher was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after herfamily! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, whenhe put his letter into her hand! She k not what to think, or how toaccount for it.They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, andevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finerreach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some timebefore Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answeredmechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncleaunt,seemedto direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, shedistinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on thatone spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy thenwas. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; inwhat manner he thought of her,whether, in defiance of everything,she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because hefelt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which wasnot like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeingher, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her withcomposure.At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mindroused her,she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.They entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the openingof the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views ofthe valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woodsoverspreading many,occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardinerexpressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might bebeyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was tenmiles round. It settled the matter;they pursued the accustomedcircuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent amonghanging woods, to the edge of the water,one of its est parts.They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air ofthe scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; andthe valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for thestream,a  walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which borderedit. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossedthe bridge,perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,who was not a great walker, could go no farther,thought only ofreturning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,therefore, obliged to submit,they took their way towards the houseon the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but theirprogress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge thetaste, was very fond of fishing,was so much engaged in watching theoccasional appearance of some trout in the water,talking to the manabout them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in thisslow manner, they were again surprised,Elizabeth’s astonishment wasquite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcyapproaching them,at no great distance. The walk being here lesssheltered than on  allowed them to see him before theymet. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for aninterview than before,resolved to appearto speak withcalmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idealasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; theturning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw thathe had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had notgot beyond the words “”“” when some unluckyrecollections obtruded,she fancied that praise of Pemberley fromher might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,she saidno more.Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind;on her pausing, he askedher if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; andshe could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking theacquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride hadrevolted, in his offer to herself. “” thoughtshe, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people offashion.”The introduction, however, was immediately made;as she named theirrelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he boreit;was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as hecould from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by theconnection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,so far from going away, turned back with them,entered intoconversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had somerelations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened mostattentively to all that passed between them,gloried in everyexpression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,his taste, or his good manners.The conversation soon turned upon fishing;she heard Mr. Darcyinvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as hechose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the sametime to supply him with fishing tackle,pointing out those parts ofthe stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who waswalking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of herwonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; thecompliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, wasextreme;continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? Fromwhat can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sakethat his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could notwork such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still loveme.”After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the twogentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to thebrink of the river for the better inspection of some curiouswater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated inMrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, foundElizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support,consequently preferredher husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece,they walked ontogether. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him toknow that she had been assured of his absence before she came to theplace,accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had beenvery unexpected--“”“informed us thatyou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before weleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected inthe country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all;said thatbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hoursbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “Theywill join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are somewho will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingleyhis sisters.”Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantlydriven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentionedbetween them;if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind wasnot very differently engaged.“” he continued after apause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allowme, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintanceduring your stay at Lambton?”The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too greatfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately feltthat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,must be the work of her brother,without looking farther, it wassatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not madehim think really ill of her.They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabethwas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered andpleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment ofthe highest kind. They soon outstripped the others;when they hadreached the carriage, Mr.Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of amile behind.He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself nottired,they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much mighthave been said,silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, butthere seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected thatshe had been travelling,they talked of MatlockDovedale withgreat perseverance. Yet timeher aunt moved slowly--and her patienceand her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.On Mr.Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go intothe housetake some refreshment; but this was declined,theyparted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed theladies into the carriage;when it drove off, Elizabeth saw himwalking slowly towards the house.The observations of her uncleaunt now began;each of thempronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite,unassuming,” said her uncle.“” replied heraunt; “but it is confined to his air,is not unbecoming. I can nowsay with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,_I_ have seen nothing of it.”“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was morethan civil; it was really attentive;there was no necessity for suchattention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”“To be sure, ” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;or rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features areperfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was sodisagreeable?”Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had likedhim better when they met in Kent than before,that she had neverseen him so pleasant as this morning.“” repliedher uncle. “Your great men often are;therefore I shall not take himat his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, andwarn me off his grounds.”Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but saidnothing.“” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I reallyshould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way byanybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when hespeaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that wouldnot give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.  to be sure, thegood lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberalmaster, I suppose,_that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehendsevery virtue.”Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication ofhis behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in asguarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from hisrelations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very differentconstruction;that his character was by no means so faulty, norWickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. Inconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniarytransactions in which they had been connected, without actually namingher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.Mrs. Gardiner was surprisedconcerned: but as they were nowapproaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way tothe charm of recollection;she was too much engaged in pointing outto her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think ofanything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they hadno sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her formeracquaintance,the evening was spent in the satisfactions of anintercourse reed after many years’ discontinuance.The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabethmuch attention for any of these  friends;she could do nothingbut think,think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, aboveall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.[Illustration]CHAPTER XLIV.[Illustration]Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visither the very day after her reaching Pemberley;was, consequently,resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their ownarrival at Lambton these visitors came. They had been walking about theplace with some of their  friends,were just returned to the innto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of acarriage drew them to a window,they saw a gentlemanlady in acurricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing thelivery, guessed what it meant,imparted no small degree of surpriseto her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which sheexpected. Her uncleaunt were all amazement;the embarrassmentof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself,manyof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a  idea onthe business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now feltthat there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from sucha quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While thesely-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation ofElizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazedat her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, shedreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much inher favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturallysuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen;as she walkedupdown the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks ofinquiring surprise in her uncleaunt as made everything worse.Miss Darcyher brother appeared,this formidable introductiontook place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since herbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she wasonly exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word fromher beyond a monosyllable.Miss Darcy was tall,on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, thoughlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed,her appearancewomanlygraceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but therewas sensegood-humour in her face,her manners were perfectlyunassuminggentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her asacuteunembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was muchrelieved by discerning such different feelings.They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley wasalso coming to wait on her;she had barely time to express hersatisfaction,prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick stepwas heard on the stairs,in a moment he entered the room. AllElizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she stillfelt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffectedcordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. Heinquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, andlookedspoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.To Mr.Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personagethan to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party beforethem, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had justarisen of Mr. Darcytheir niece, directed their observation towardseach with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry;they soon drew fromthose inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least k whatit was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little indoubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration wasevident enough.Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain thefeelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own,tomake herself agreeable to all;in the latter object, where shefeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whomshe endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager,Darcy determined, to bepleased.[Illustration:     “”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister;oh!how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in alike manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than onformer occasions,once or twice pleased herself with the notionthat, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to hisbehaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. Nolook appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothingoccurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. Onthis point she was soon satisfied;two or three little circumstancesoccurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoteda recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness,a wish ofsaying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. Heobserved to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, andin a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very longtime since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she couldreply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact;he afterwardstook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,nor in the preceding remark; but there was a looka manner whichgave them meaning.It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; butwhenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of generalcomplaisance,in all that he said, she heard an accent so farremoved from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced herthat the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived oneday. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance,courting thegood opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago wouldhave been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained,recollectedtheir last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, thechange was so great,struck so forcibly on her mind, that she couldhardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in thecompany of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relationsat Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free fromself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance couldresult from the success of his endeavours,when even theacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would drawdown the ridiculecensure of the ladies both of Netherfield andRosings.Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour;when they aroseto depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressingtheir wish of seeing Mr.Mrs. Gardiner, to dinnerat Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with adiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowinghow _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to itsacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment thanany dislike of the proposal,seeing in her husband, who was fond ofsociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage forher attendance,the day after the next was fixed on.Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabethagain, having still a great deal to say to her,many inquiries tomake after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing allthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; andon this account, as well as some others, found herself, when theirvisitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with somesatisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had beenlittle. Eager to be alone,fearful of inquiries or hints from heruncleaunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear theirfavourable opinion of Bingley,then hurried away to dress.But she had no reason to fear Mr.Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it wasnot their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she wasmuch better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much tointerest, but nothing to justify inquiry.Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as faras their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They couldnot be untouched by his politeness;had they drawn his characterfrom their own feelingshis servant’s report, without any referenceto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was knownwould not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,however, in believing the housekeeper;they soon became sensiblethat the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was fouryears old,whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to behastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence oftheir Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They hadnothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had,if not,it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market townwhere the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that hewas a liberal man,did much good among the poor.With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not heldthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with theson of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-knownfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behindhim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more thanthe last;the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was notlong enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; andshe lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. Shecertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago,shehad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of hisvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for sometime ceased to be repugnant to her feelings;it was now heightenedinto somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in hisfavour,bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respectesteem,there was a motive within her of good-will which could not beoverlooked. It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having onceloved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all thepetulanceacrimony of her manner in rejecting him,all theunjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had beenpersuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on thisaccidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; andwithout any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the goodopinion of her friends,bent on making her known to his sister. Sucha change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment butgratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, assuch, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by nomeans unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected,she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in hiswelfare;she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare todepend upon herself,how far it would be for the happiness of boththat she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she stillpossessed, of bringing on the real of his addresses.It had been settled in the evening, between the auntniece, thatsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them on the veryday of her arrival at Pemberley--for she had reached it only to a latebreakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, bysome exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that itwould be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the followingmorning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though whenshe asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had beenreed the day before,a positive engagement made of his meetingsome of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.[Illustration:     “”]CHAPTER XLV.[Illustration]Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her hadoriginated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcomeher appearance at Pemberley must be to her,was curious to knowwith how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would nowbe reed.On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows,opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woodyhills behind the house,of the beautiful oaksSpanish chestnutswhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting therewith Mrs. Hurstthe lady with whom she lived inLondon. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended withall that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shynessthefear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselvesinferior the belief of her being proudreserved. Mrs. Gardiner andher niece, however, did her justice,pitied her.By Mrs. HurstMiss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; andon their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, agenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kindof discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of theothers;between herMrs. Gardiner, with occasional help fromElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if shewished for courage enough to join in it;sometimes did venture ashort sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched bythat she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, withoutcalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented herfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at aninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessityof saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected everymoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, shefeared, that the master of the house might be amongst them;whethershe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. Aftersitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing MissBingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a coldinquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equalindifferencebrevity,the other said no more.The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by theentrance of servants with cold meat, cake,a variety of all thefinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many asignificant looksmile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had beengiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the wholeparty; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat;thebeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines,peaches, soon collectedthem round the table.While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whethershe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by thefeelings which prevailed on his entering the room;then, though buta moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began toregret that he came.He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three othergentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river;had left himonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit toGeorgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wiselyresolved to be perfectly easyunembarrassed;--a resolution the morenecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because shesaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviourwhen he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentivecuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of thesmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of itsobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate,her attentionsto Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’sentrance, exerted herself much more to talk;Elizabeth saw that hewas anxious for his sisterherself to get acquainted,forwarded,as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. MissBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took thefirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabethinstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts;thevarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, shepresently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. Whileshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightenedcomplexion, earnestly looking at her,his sister overcome withconfusion,unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known whatpain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would haverefrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discomposeElizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believedher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her inDarcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the folliesand absurdities by which some part of her family were connected withthat corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’smeditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecywas possible, except to Elizabeth;from all Bingley’s connectionsher brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wishwhich Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becominghereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan;withoutmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from MissBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concernfor the welfare of his friend.Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; andas  vexeddisappointed, dared not approach nearer toWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be ableto speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcelyrecollected her interest in the affair;the very circumstance whichhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to havefixed them on her moremore cheerfully.Their visit did not continue long after the questionanswer abovementioned;while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage,Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’sperson, behaviour,dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Herbrother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgmentcould not err;he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leaveGeorgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely andamiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not helprepeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.“” she cried: “Inever in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.She is grown so browncoarse! LouisaI were agreeing that weshould not have known her again.”However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contentedhimself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration thanher being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in thesummer.“” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could seeany beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has nobrilliancy;her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wantscharacter; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth aretolerable, but not out of the common way;as for her eyes, whichhave sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anythingextraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do notlike at all;in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiencywithout fashion, which is intolerable.”Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was notthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not alwayswise;in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all thesuccess she expected. He was resolutely silent, however; and, from adetermination of making him speak, she continued,--“I remember, when we first k her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we allwere to find that she was a reputed beauty;I particularly recollectyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_a beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards sheseemed to improve on you,I believe you thought her rather pretty atone time.”“” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_was only when I first k her; for it is many months since I haveconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”He then went away,Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction ofhaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.Mrs. GardinerElizabeth talked of all that had occurred during theirvisit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested themboth. The looksbehaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talkedof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything buthimself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought ofhim,Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’sbeginning the subject.[Illustration]Chapter XLVI.[Illustration]Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter fromJane on their first arrival at Lambton;this disappointment had beenreed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but onthe third her repining was over,her sister justified, by thereceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked thatit had been mis-sent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, asJane had written the direction remarkably ill.They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in;heruncleaunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off bythemselves. The one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had beenwritten five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all theirlittle partiesengagements, with such s as the country afforded;but the latter half, which was dated a day later,written in evidentagitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:--“Since writing the above, dearest  something has occurred of amost unexpectedserious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--beassured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotlandwith one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine oursurprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I amvery, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willingto hope the best,that his character has been misunderstood.Thoughtlessindiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (andlet us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice isdisinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. Howthankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said againsthim; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night abouttwelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning ateight. The express was sent off directly. My dear  they must havepassed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expecthim here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her oftheir intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poormother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardlyknow what I have written.”Without allowing herself time for consideration,scarcely knowingwhat she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized theother,opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: ithad been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; Iwish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, myhead is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad s for you,and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickhamand our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it hastaken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not goneto Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton theday before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s shortletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to GretnaGreen, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeatedto Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.,intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, butno farther; for on entering that place, they removed into ahackney-coach,dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue theLondon road. I know not what to think. After making every possibleinquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,anxiously reing them at all the turnpikes,at the inns in Barnetand Hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen topass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, andbroke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.I am sincerely grieved for himMrs. F.; but no one can throw anyblame on them. Our distress, my dear  is very great. My father andmother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Manycircumstances might make it more eligible for them to be marriedprivately in town than to pursue their first plan;even if _he_could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections,which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposedto depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed myhopes,said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor motheris really ill,keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would bebetter, but this is not to be expected;as to my father, I never inmy life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealedtheir attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannotwonder. I am truly glad, dearest  that you have been sparedsomething of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock isover, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish,however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my penagain to do, what I have just told you I would not; but circumstancesare such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here assoon as possible. I know my dear uncleaunt so well, that I am notafraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask ofthe former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly,to try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; buthis excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in thebestsafest way,Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brightonagain to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle’s advice andassistance would be everything in the world; he will immediatelycomprehend what I must feel,I rely upon his goodness.”“”darting from her seatas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing amoment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it wasopened by a servant,Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face andimpetuous manner made him start,before he could recover himselfenough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’ssituation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;.”“”with more feeling thanpoliteness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr.Mrs. Gardiner. You arenot well enough; you cannot go yourself.”Elizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her,she felt howlittle would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling backthe servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless anaccent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master andmistress home instantly.On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, andlooking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentlenesscommiseration,“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give youpresent relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”“ I thank you,”endeavouring to recover herself. “Thereis nothing the matter with me. I am quite well, I am only distressed bysome dreadful s which I have just received from Longbourn.”She burst into tears as she alluded to it,for a few minutes couldnot speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only saysomething indistinctly of his[Illustration:     “”]concern,observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spokeagain. “I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful s. Itcannot be concealed from anyone. My youngest sister has left all herfriends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr.Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him toowell to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing thatcan tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”Darcy was fixed in astonishment.“”in a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_might have prevented it! _I_ who k what he was. Had I but explainedsome part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Hadhis character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all,all too late now.”“” cried Darcy: “grieved--shocked. But is itcertain, absolutely certain?”“ yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night,were tracedalmost to London, but not beyond: they are certainly not gone toScotland.”“”“My father has gone to London,Jane has written to beg my uncle’simmediate assistance,we shall be off,  in half an hour. Butnothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How issuch a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I havenot the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character, oh! had I known whatI ought, what I dared to do! But I k not--I was afraid of doing toomuch. Wretched, wretched mistake!”Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her,was walking upand down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his airgloomy. Elizabeth soon observed,instantly understood it. Her powerwas sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of familyweakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neitherwonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothingconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. Itwas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her ownwishes;never had she so honestly felt that she could have lovedhim, as now, when all love must be vain.But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--thehumiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all--soon swallowed upevery private care;covering her face with her handkerchief,Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause ofseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by thevoice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spokecompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--“I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anythingto plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not tormentyou with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having thepleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”“ yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say thaturgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth aslong as it is possible. I know it cannot be long.”He readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow forher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at presentreason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, withonly one serious parting look, went away.As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that theyshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as hadmarked their several meetings in Derbyshire;as she threw aretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full ofcontradictionsvarieties, sighed at the perverseness of thosefeelings which would now have promoted its continuance,wouldformerly have rejoiced in its termination.If gratitudeesteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’schange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But ifotherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable orunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on afirst interview with its object,even before two words have beenexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had givensomewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the otherless interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him gowith regret;in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy mustproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretchedbusiness. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained ahope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the leastof all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the firstletter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marryfor money;how Lydia could ever have attached him had appearedincomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachmentas this, she might have sufficient charms;though she did notsuppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without theintention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neitherher virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easyprey.She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, thatLydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia hadwanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes oneofficer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentionsraised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continuallyfluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect andmistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she nowfeel it!She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot toshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in afamily so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, andrequiring constant attendance;though almost persuaded that nothingcould be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmostimportance,till he entered the room the misery of her impatiencewas severe. Mr.Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,by the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; butsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated thecause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud,dwelling onthe postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had neverbeen a favourite with them, Mr.Mrs. Gardiner could not but bedeeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it;afterthe first exclamations of surprisehorror, Mr. Gardiner readilypromised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting noless, thanked him with tears of gratitude;all three being actuatedby one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedilysettled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to bedone about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy washere when you sent for us;--was it so?”“Yes;I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement._That_ is all settled.”“” repeated the other, as she ran into her room toprepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the realtruth?  that I k how it was!”But wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in thehurryconfusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisureto be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment wasimpossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share ofbusiness as well as her aunt,amongst the rest there were notes tobe written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for theirsudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed;Mr.Gardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothingremained to be done but to go;Elizabeth, after all the misery ofthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she couldhave supposed, seated in the carriage,on the road to Longbourn.[Illustration:     “”]CHAPTER XLVII.[Illustration]“” said her uncle, as theydrove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am muchmore inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of thematter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should formsuch a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected orfriendless,who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family, that Iam strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friendswould not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by theregiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation isnot adequate to the risk.”“”brightening up for a moment.“” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’sopinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, andinterest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill ofWickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believehim capable of it?”“Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglectI can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare nothope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been thecase?”“” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proofthat they are not gone to Scotland.”“ but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such apresumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on theBarnet road.”“ then,--supposing them to be in London--they may be there, thoughfor the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It isnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side;itmight strike them that they could be more economically, though lessexpeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.”“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must theirmarriage be private?  no, no--this is not likely. His most particularfriend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intendingto marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. Hecannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has shebeyond youth, health,good humour, that could make him for her sakeforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to whatrestraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on adishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I knownothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to yourother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has nobrothers to step forward;he might imagine, from my father’sbehaviour, from his indolencethe little attention he has everseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ woulddo as littlethink as little about it, as any father could do, insuch a matter.”“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”“It does seem,it is most shocking, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, withtears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decencyvirtue in sucha point should admit of doubt.  really, I know not what to say.Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young: she has neverbeen taught to think on serious subjects;for the last half year,nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusementand vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idleand frivolous manner,to adopt any opinions that came in her way.Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,flirtation,officers, have been in her head. She has been doingeverything in her power, by thinkingtalking on the subject, to givegreater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; whichare naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has everycharm of personaddress that can captivate a woman.”“” said her aunt, “does not think so ill ofWickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.”“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might betheir former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, whatWickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in everysense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he isas falsedeceitful as he is insinuating.”“” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosityas to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.“” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you the other dayof his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy;you, yourself, when last atLongbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved withsuch forbearanceliberality towards him. And there are othercircumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while torelate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. Fromwhat he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he k to the contrary himself. Hemust know that she was as amiableunpretending as we have foundher.”“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what youand Jane seem so well to understand?”“ yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent,sawso much both of Mr. Darcyhis relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I wasignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home the ----shirewas to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was thecase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought itnecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could itapparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all theneighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when itwas settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity ofopening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ couldbe in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such aconsequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was farenough from my thoughts.”“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, Isuppose, to believe them fond of each other?”“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on eitherside;had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be awarethat ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When firsthe entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we allwere. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him forthe first two months: but he never distinguished _her_ by any particularattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant andwild admiration, her fancy for him gave way,others of the regiment,who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be addedto their fears, hopes,conjectures, on this interesting subject byits repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, duringthe whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she couldfind no interval of ease or forgetfulness.They travelled as expeditiously as possible;sleeping one night onthe road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day. It was a comfortto Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by longexpectations.The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standingon the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock;when thecarriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up theirfacesdisplayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety ofcapersfrisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.Elizabeth jumped out;after giving each of them a hasty kiss,hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs fromher mother’s apartment, immediately met her.Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled theeyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had beenheard of the fugitives.“” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hopeeverything will be well.”“”“ he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”“”“We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to saythat he had arrived in safety,to give me his directions, which Iparticularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not writeagain, till he had something of importance to mention.”“”“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatlyshaken. She is upstairs,will have great satisfaction in seeing youall. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. MaryKitty, thankHeaven! are quite well.”“”“You look pale. How much youmust have gone through!”Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well;theirconversation, which had been passing while Mr.Mrs. Gardiner wereengaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach ofthe whole party. Jane ran to her uncleaunt,welcomed andthanked them both, with alternate smilestears.When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabethhad already asked were of course repeated by the others,they soonfound that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yetdeserted her; she still expected that it would all end well,thatevery morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; withtearslamentations of regret, invectives against the villainousconduct of Wickham,complaints of her own sufferingsill-usage;blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence theerrors of her daughter must be principally owing.“”“to carry my point in going to Brightonwith all my family, _this_ would not have happened: but poor dear Lydiahad nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go outof their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on theirside, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she hadbeen well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to havethe charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor, dearchild! And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away,I know he will fightWickham, wherever he meets him,then he will be killed,what isto become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is coldin his grave;if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know whatwe shall do.”They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas;Mr. Gardiner, aftergeneral assurances of his affection for herall her family, told herthat he meant to be in London the very next day,would assist Mr.Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.“” added he: “though it is right to beprepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, wemay gain some s of them;till we know that they are not married,and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over aslost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother,make himcome home with me to Gracechurch Street,then we may consulttogether as to what is to be done.”“ my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what Icould most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,wherever they may be;if they are not married already, _make_ themmarry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, buttell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet fromfighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightenedout of my wits;have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,such spasms in my side,pains in my head,such beatings at myheart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dearLydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,for she does not know which are the best warehouses.  brother, howkind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavoursin the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well inher hopes as her fears;after talking with her in this manner tilldinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on thehousekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.Though her brothersister were persuaded that there was no realoccasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt tooppose it; for they k that she had not prudence enough to hold hertongue before the servants, while they waited at table,judged itbetter that _one_ only of the household,the one whom they couldmost trust, should comprehend all her fearssolicitude on thesubject.In the dining-room they were soon joined by MaryKitty, who had beentoo busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearancebefore. One came from her books,the other from her toilette. Thefaces of both, however, were tolerably calm;no change was visiblein either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the angerwhich she had herself incurred in the business, had given something moreof fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she wasmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenanceof grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,--“This is a most unfortunate affair,will probably be much talked of.But we must stem the tide of malice,pour into the wounded bosoms ofeach other the balm of sisterly consolation.”Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this usefullesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable, that onefalse step involves her in endless ruin, that her reputation is no lessbrittle than it is beautiful,that she cannot be too much guarded inher behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed tomake any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with suchkind of moral extractions from the evil before them.In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half anhour by themselves;Elizabeth instantly availed herself of theopportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager tosatisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequelof this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain,MissBennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continuedthe subject by saying, “But tell me alleverything about it which Ihave not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did ColonelForster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopementtook place? They must have seen them together for ever.”“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am sogrieved for him. His behaviour was attentivekind to the utmost. He_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he hadany idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehensionfirst got abroad, it hastened his journey.”“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know oftheir intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”“Yes; but when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything oftheir plan,would not give his real opinion about it. He did notrepeat his persuasion of their not marrying,from _that_ I aminclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before.”“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained adoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt alittle uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him inmarriage, because I k that his conduct had not been always quiteright. My fathermother k nothing of that; they only felt howimprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very naturaltriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last lettershe had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of theirbeing in love with each other many weeks.”“”“ I believe not.”“And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does heknow his real character?”“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerlydid. He believed him to be imprudentextravagant;since this sadaffair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt:but I hope this may be false.”“ Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we k of him,this could not have happened!”“” replied her sister.“But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing whattheir present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”“”“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to hiswife?”“”Jane then took it from her pocket-book,gave it to Elizabeth. Thesewere the contents:--     /* NIND “My dear Harriet, */     “You will laugh when you know where I am gone,I cannot help     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am     missed. I am going to Gretna Green,if you cannot guess with     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the     world I love,he is an angel. I should never be happy without     him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the     surprise the greater when I write to them,sign my name Lydia     Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for     laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my     engagement,dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will     excuse me when he knows all,tell him I will dance with him at     the next ball we meet with great pleasure. I shall send for my     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to     mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed     up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will     drink to our good journey.“Your affectionate friend,“LYDIA BENNET.”“ thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she hadfinished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! Butat least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a_scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full tenminutes. My mother was taken ill immediately,the whole house insuch confusion!”“ Jane,”“was there a servant belonging to it whodid not know the whole story before the end of the day?”“I do not know: I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time isvery difficult. My mother was in hysterics;though I endeavoured togive her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so muchas I might have done. But the horror of what might possibly happenalmost took from me my faculties.”“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not lookwell. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every careanxietyupon yourself alone.”“MaryKitty have been very kind,would have shared in everyfatigue,  but I did not think it right for either of them.Kitty is slightdelicate,Mary studies so much that her hours ofrepose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn onTuesday, after my father went away;was so good as to stay tillThursday with me. She was of great usecomfort to us all,LadyLucas has been very kind: she walked here on Wednesday morning tocondole with us,offered her services, or any of her daughters, ifthey could be of use to us.”“She had better have stayed at home,”“perhaps she_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see toolittle of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence,insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance,be satisfied.”She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father hadintended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.“He meant, I believe,”“to go to Epsom, the place wherethey last changed horses, see the postilions,try if anything couldbe made out from them. His principal object must be to discover thenumber of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had comewith a fare from London;as he thought the circumstance of agentlemanlady’s removing from one carriage into another might beremarked, he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhowdiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, hedetermined to make inquiries there,hoped it might not be impossibleto find out the standnumber of the coach. I do not know of anyother designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in findingout even so much as this.”[Illustration:     The Post]CHAPTER XLVIII.[Illustration]The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the nextmorning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.His family k him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent anddilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence tosend; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constantinformation of what was going on;their uncle promised, at parting,to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could, tothe great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the onlysecurity for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.Mrs. Gardinerthe children were to remain in Hertfordshire a fewdays longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable toher nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet,was agreat comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt alsovisited them frequently,always, as she said, with the design ofcheeringheartening them up--though, as she never came withoutreporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she foundthem.All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three monthsbefore, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debtto every tradesman in the place,his intrigues, all honoured withthe title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; andeverybody began to find out that they had always distrusted theappearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit abovehalf of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance ofher sister’s ruin still more certain;even Jane, who believed stillless of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was nowcome, when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never beforeentirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained somes of them.Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received aletter from him: it told them, that on his arrival he had immediatelyfound out his brother,persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street.That Mr. Bennet had been to EpsomClapham, before his arrival, butwithout gaining any satisfactory information;that he was nowdetermined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennetthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their firstcoming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himselfdid not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother waseager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr.Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London, andpromised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to thiseffect:--“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, ifpossible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely toknow in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If therewere anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining sucha clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we havenothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything inhis power to satisfy us on this head.  on second thoughts, perhapsLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than anyother person.”Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference forher authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give anyinformation of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a fatherand mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible,however, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able togive more information;though she was not very sanguine in expectingit, the application was a something to look forward to.Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxiouspart of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters wasthe first grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters,whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated;everysucceeding day was expected to bring some s of importance.But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived fortheir father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Janehad received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,she accordingly read;Elizabeth, who k what curiosities hisletters always were, looked over her,read it likewise. It was asfollows:--     /* “My dear Sir, */     “I feel myself called upon, by our relationship,my situation     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter     from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins    myself sincerely sympathize with you,all your respectable     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that     must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent’s mind. The     death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of     this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness     of behaviour in your     [Illustration:“”     [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]     daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though,     at the same time, for the consolation of yourselfMrs. Bennet,     I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally     bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an     age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in     which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by     Lady Catherineher daughter, to whom I have related the affair.     They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one     daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for     who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect     themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me,     moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain     event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been     involved in all your sorrowdisgrace. Let me advise you, then,     my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off     your unworthy child from your affection for ever,leave her to     reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.“I am, dear sir,” etc., etc.Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer fromColonel Forster;then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept upany connection,it was certain that he had no near one living. Hisformer acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in themilitia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendshipwith any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed outas likely to give any s of him. And in the wretched state of his ownfinances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition tohis fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations; for it had just transpiredthat he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would benecessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in thetown, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardinerdid not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family;Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!”“This is whollyunexpected; I had not an idea of it.”Mr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see theirfather at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Renderedspiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, he had yielded tohis brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family andleave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisablefor continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she didnot express so much satisfaction as her children expected, consideringwhat her anxiety for his life had been before.“What! is he coming home,without poor Lydia?”“Sure hewill not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,and make him marry her, if he comes away?”As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that sheand her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennetcame from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of theirjourney,brought its master back to Longbourn.Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about ElizabethherDerbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, oftheir being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come fromPemberley.The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse forthe lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could befairly conjectured from _that_,--though Elizabeth, who was by this timetolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly awarethat, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread ofLydia’s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,one sleepless night out of two.When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usualphilosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in thehabit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken himaway;it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak ofit.It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, thatElizabeth ventured to introduce the subject;then, on her brieflyexpressing her sorrow for what he must have endured,“Saynothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,and I ought to feel it.”“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone tofall into it!   let me once in my life feel how much I havebeen to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.It will pass away soon enough.”“Do you suppose them to be in London?”“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.“She is happy, then,”“and her residence therewill probably be of some duration.” after a short silence, he continued, “ I bear you noill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”They were interrupted by  who came to fetch her mother’stea.“This is a parade,”“which does one good; it gives such anelegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in mylibrary, in my nightcappowdering gown,give as much trouble asI can,--or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”“I am not going to run away, papa,”“If _I_should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”“_You_ go to Brighton! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne,for fifty pounds!  Kitty, I have at least learnt to be cautious, andyou will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my houseagain, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutelyprohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you arenever to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent tenminutes of every day in a rational manner.”Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.“ well,”“do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a goodgirl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end ofthem.”[Illustration]CHAPTER XLIX.[Illustration]Two days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as JaneElizabeth were walkingtogether in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeepercoming towards them,concluding that she came to call them to theirmother, went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons,when they approached her, she said to  “I beg your pardon,madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got somegood s from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”“Dear madam,”“don’t you knowthere is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been herethis half hour,master has had a letter.”Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. Theyran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to thelibrary;--their father was in neither;they were on the point ofseeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by thebutler, who said,--“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards thelittle copse.”Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberatelypursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running asElizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,came up with him,eagerly cried out,--“ papa, what s? what s? have you heard from my uncle?”“ I have had a letter from him by express.”“what s does it bring--good or bad?”“What is there of good to be expected?”taking the letter fromhis pocket; “but perhaps you would like to read it.”Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.“Read it aloud,”“for I hardly know myself what it isabout.”     /* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Monday, August 2_. */“My dear Brother,     “At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece,such     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after     you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what     part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet.     It is enough to know they are discovered: I have seen them     both----”     [Illustration:“”     [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]     “Then it is as I always hoped,”“they are married!”     Elizabeth read on: “I have seen them both. They are not married,     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your     children after the decease of yourselfmy sister; and,     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your     life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which,     considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as     far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to     be. The world has been deceived in that respect;I am happy to     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.     If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act     in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will     immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper     settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming     to town again; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn,depend on     my diligencecare. Send back your answer as soon as you can,    be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my     niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will     approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as     anything more is determined on. “”“”when she had finished. “Can it bepossible that he will marry her?”“” said hersister. “”“” said Elizabeth.“”Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before hewrote.“”“come backwrite immediately.Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”“”“if you dislike the troubleyourself.”“” he replied; “”And so saying, he turned back with them,walked towards the house.“”“but the terms, I suppose, must becomplied with.”“”“”“ yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But thereare two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much moneyyour uncle has laid down to bring it about;the other, how I am everto pay him.”“” cried Jane, “”“I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slighta temptation as one hundred a year during my life,fifty after I amgone.”“”“though it had not occurred to mebefore. His debts to be discharged,something still to remain! it must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he hasdistressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”“” said her father. “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthingless than ten thousand pounds: I should be sorry to think so ill of him,in the very beginning of our relationship.”“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to berepaid?”Mr. Bennet made no answer;each of them, deep in thought, continuedsilent till they reached the house. Their father then went to thelibrary to write,the girls walked into the breakfast-room.“”as soon as theywere by themselves. “How strange this is!for _this_ we are to bethankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!  Lydia!”“”“that he certainly wouldnot marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kinduncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that tenthousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has childrenof his own,may have more. How could he spare half ten thousandpounds?”“” saidElizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shallexactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham hasnot sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncleaunt can never berequited. Their taking her home,affording her their personalprotectioncountenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage asyears of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she isactually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when shefirst sees my aunt!”“” saidJane: “I hopetrust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marryher is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way ofthinking. Their mutual affection will steady them;I flatter myselfthey will settle so quietly,live in so rational a manner, as may intime make their past imprudence forgotten.”“” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, norI, nor anybody, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihoodperfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,therefore,asked their father whether he would not wish them to makeit known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coollyreplied,--“”“”“Take whatever you like,get away.”Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table,they went upstairstogether. MaryKitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communicationwould, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good s,the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. Assoon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married,her joy burst forth,every following sentence added to itsexuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as shehad ever been fidgety from alarmvexation. To know that her daughterwould be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for herfelicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.“” she cried: “this is delightful indeed! She willbe married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! Mygood, kind brother! I k how it would be--I k he would manageeverything. How I long to see her!to see dear Wickham too! But theclothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner aboutthem directly.  my dear, run down to your father,ask him howmuch he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dearLydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence ofthese transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.“”“in a greatmeasure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself toassist Mr. Wickham with money.”“” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it buther own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, Imy childrenmust have had all his money, you know;it is the first time we haveever had anything from him except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.In a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How wellit sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am insuch a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate,youwrite for me. We will settle with your father about the moneyafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, andcambric,would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, hadnot Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till herfather was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,would be of small importance;her mother was too happy to be quiteso obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.“”“as soon as I am dressed,tell thegood, good s to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call onLady LucasMrs. Long. Kitty, run downorder the carriage. Anairing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I doanything for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have youheard the good s? Miss Lydia is going to be married;you shallall have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received hercongratulations amongst the rest,then, sick of this folly, tookrefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. Poor Lydia’ssituation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, shehad need to be thankful. She felt it so;though, in looking forward,neither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justlyexpected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, onlytwo hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.[Illustration:“”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER L.[Illustration]Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, forthe better provision of his children,of his wife, if she survivedhim. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in thatrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever ofhonour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction ofprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain tobe her husband might then have rested in its proper place.He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyoneshould be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law;hewas determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectlyuseless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to joinin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age,the widowand younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughterssuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come;Mrs.Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that hewould. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then toolate to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy;herhusband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding theirincome.Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet andthe children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst thelatter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, withregard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled,Mr. Bennetcould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. Interms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, thoughexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfectapprobation of all that was done,his willingness to fulfil theengagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposedthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would bedone with so little inconvenience to himself as by the presentarrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by thehundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her boardpocketallowance,the continual presents in money which passed to herthrough her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little withinthat sum.That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, wasanother very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to haveas little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transportsof rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, henaturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soondespatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick inits execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he wasindebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send anymessage to her.The good s quickly spread through the house;with proportionatespeed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decentphilosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage ofconversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as thehappiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distantfarm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her;thegood-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before fromall the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spiritin this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her miserywas considered certain.It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on thishappy day she again took her seat at the head of her table,inspirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to hertriumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object ofher wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point ofaccomplishment,her thoughtsher words ran wholly on thoseattendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins,  carriages, andservants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for aproper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or consideringwhat their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size andimportance.“”“if the Gouldings would quit it, or thegreat house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth istoo far off. I could not bear to have her ten miles from me;as forPurvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while theservants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son anddaughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in thisneighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage theimprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: itsoon led to another;Mrs. Bennet found, with amazementhorror,that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for hisdaughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark ofaffection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehendit. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivableresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which hermarriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believepossible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense ofshame at her elopingliving with Wickham a fortnight before theytook place.Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress ofthe moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears forher sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the propertermination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal itsunfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on thespot.She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There werefew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’sfrailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear ofdisadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate thereseemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage beenconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed thatMr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every otherobjection would now be added an alliancerelationship of the nearestkind with the man whom he so justly scorned.From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. Thewish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of hisfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such ablow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though shehardly k of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could nolonger hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when thereseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced thatshe could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely theyshould meet.What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that theproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would nowhave been gladlygratefully received! He was as generous, shedoubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,there must be a triumph.She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, indispositiontalents, would most suit her. His understanding andtemper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. Itwas an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her easeand liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;and from his judgment, information,knowledge of the world, she musthave received benefit of greater importance.But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude whatconnubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, andprecluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in theirfamily.How WickhamLydia were to be supported in tolerable independence shecould not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong toa couple who were only brought together because their passions werestronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’sacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness topromote the welfare of any of his family;concluded with entreatiesthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principalpurport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolvedon quitting the militia.“” he added, “as soon as hismarriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, inconsidering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on hisaccountmy niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into theRegulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who areablewilling to assist him in the army. He has the promise of anensigncy in General----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. It isan advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. Hepromises fairly;I hope among different people, where they may eachhave a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I havewritten to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickhaminnear Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I havepledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carryingsimilar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoina list, according to his information? He has given in all his debts; Ihope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, andall will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,unless they are first invited to Longbourn;I understand from Mrs.Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before sheleaves the south. She is well,begs to be dutifully remembered toyouher mother.--“E. GARDINER.”Mr. Bennethis daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’sremoval from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. ButMrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled inthe north, just when she had expected most pleasurepride in hercompany, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing inHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such apity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquaintedwith everybody,had so many favourites.“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,”“it will be quite shockingto send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that shelikes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General----’sregiment.”His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of beingadmitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,received at first an absolute negative. But JaneElizabeth, whoagreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings andconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,urged him so earnestly, yet so rationallyso mildly, to receive herand her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he wasprevailed on to think as they thought,act as they wished. And theirmother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to showher married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished tothe north. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, hesent his permission for them to come;it was settled, that, as soonas the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabethwas surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme;and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with himwould have been the last object of her wishes.[Illustration:“”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER LI.[Illustration]Their sister’s wedding-day arrived;JaneElizabeth felt for herprobably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meetthem at----,they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrivalwas dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets--and Jane more especially, whogave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_been the culprit,was wretched in the thought of what her sistermust endure.They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receivethem. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up tothe door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,anxious, uneasy.Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, andshe ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, andwelcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile toWickham, who followed his lady;wished them both joy, with analacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quiteso cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity;he scarcelyopened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, wasenough to provoke him.Elizabeth was disgusted,even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia wasLydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,fearless. She turnedfrom sister to sister, demanding their congratulations;when atlength they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice ofsome little alteration in it,observed, with a laugh, that it was agreat while since she had been there.Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his mannerswere always so pleasing, that, had his characterhis marriage beenexactly what they ought, his smileshis easy address, while heclaimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabethhad not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she satdown, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to theimpudence of an impudent man. _She_ blushed,Jane blushed; but thecheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation ofcolour.There was no want of discourse. The brideher mother could neitherof them talk fast enough;Wickham, who happened to sit nearElizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,with a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in herreplies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in theworld. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain;Lydia ledvoluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to forthe world.“Only think of its being three months,”“since I went away:it seems but a fortnight, I declare;yet there have been thingsenough happened in the time.  when I went away, I am sureI had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though Ithought it would be very good fun if I was.”Her father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth lookedexpressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything ofwhich she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--“ mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I wasafraid they might not;we overtook William Goulding in his curricle,so I was determined he should know it,so I let down the side glassnext to him,took off my glovelet my hand just rest upon thewindow frame, so that he might see the ring,then I bowed andsmiled like anything.”Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got upran out of the room;and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall tothe dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, withanxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand,hear her say toher eldest sister,--“Ah, Jane, I take your place now,you must go lower, because I am amarried woman.”It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassmentfrom which she had been so wholly free at first. Her easegoodspirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases,alltheir other neighbours,to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” byeach of them;in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ringand boast of being married to Mrs. Hillthe two housemaids.“ mamma,”when they were all returned to thebreakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he acharming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope theymay have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is theplace to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”“Very true;if I had my will we should.  my dear Lydia, I don’tat all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”“ Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.Youpapa,my sisters, must come downsee us. We shall be atNewcastle all the winter,I dare say there will be some balls,Iwill take care to get good partners for them all.”“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sistersbehind you;I dare say I shall get husbands for them before thewinter is over.”“I thank you for my share of the favour,”“but I do notparticularly like your way of getting husbands.”Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickhamhad received his commission before he left London,he was to joinhis regiment at the end of a fortnight.No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; andshe made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, andhaving very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable toall; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as didthink than such as did not.Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected tofind it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed herpresent observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, thattheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love ratherthan by his;she would have wondered why, without violently caringfor her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certainthat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; andif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunityof having a companion.Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on everyoccasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He dideverything best in the world;she was sure he would kill more birdson the first of September than anybody else in the country.One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her twoelder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,--“ I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You werenot by, when I told mamma,the others, all about it. Are not youcurious to hear how it was managed?”“ really,”“I think there cannot be too littlesaid on the subject.”“ You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We weremarried, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were inthat parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleveno’clock. My uncleauntI were to go together;the otherswere to meet us at the church.“ Monday morning came,I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,you know, that something would happen to put it off,then I shouldhave gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I wasdressing, preachingtalking away just as if she was reading asermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I wasthinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whetherhe would be married in his blue coat.“so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would neverbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncleauntwere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believeme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there afortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London wasrather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.“so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle wascalled away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.  youknow, when once they get together, there is no end of it.  I was sofrightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time,then we all setout. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been preventedgoing, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done aswell.”“” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.“ yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know.  gracious me!I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promisedthem so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”“”“say not another word on thesubject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”“ certainly,”though burning with curiosity; “we willask you no questions.”“” said Lydia; “for if you did, I should certainly tell youall,then Wickham would be so angry.”On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of herpower, by running away.But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least itwas impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at hersister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene,exactly among people,where he had apparently least to do,least temptation to go.Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapidwild, hurried into herbrain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, asplacing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. Shecould not bear such suspense;hastily seizing a sheet of paper,wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of whatLydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had beenintended.“”“what my curiosity must be toknow how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparativelyspeaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at sucha time. Pray write instantly,let me understand it--unless it is,for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems tothink necessary;then I must endeavour to be satisfied withignorance.”“” she added to herself,she finished theletter; “and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourablemanner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricksstratagems to find itout.”Jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak toElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad ofit:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive anysatisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.[Illustration:“.”]CHAPTER LII.[Illustration]Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter assoon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it, thanhurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to beinterrupted, she sat down on one of the benches,prepared to behappy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did notcontain a denial.     /* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Sept. 6_. */“My dear Niece,     “I have just received your letter,shall devote this whole     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will     not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.     Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,     that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_     side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my     impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am;nothing     but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed     him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent    ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.     Darcy called,was shut up with him several hours. It was all     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked     as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he     had found out where your sisterMr. Wickham were,that he     had seentalked with them both--Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.     From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after     ourselves,came to town with the resolution of hunting for     them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to     himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as     to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or     confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken     pride,confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to     lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to     speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step     forward,endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never     disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was     more than _we_ had;the consciousness of this was another     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy,was     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,    has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.     Younge was, he k, intimately acquainted with Wickham;he     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery    corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be     found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in     London;had she been able to receive them into her house, they     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----     Street. He saw Wickham,afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade     her to quit her present disgraceful situation,return to her     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,     offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none     of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or     other,it did not much signify when. Since such were her     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secureexpedite a     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he     easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself     obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour     which were very pressing;scrupled not to lay all the ill     consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to     resign his commission immediately;as to his future situation,     he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but     he did not know where,he k he should have nothing to live     on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.     Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have     been able to do something for him,his situation must have been     benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,     that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making     his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the     temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there     was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything     being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make     your uncle acquainted with it,he first called in Gracechurch     Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not     be seen;Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did     not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly     consult as your uncle,therefore readily postponed seeing him     till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,    till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called     on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your     uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk     together. They met again on Sunday,then _I_ saw him too. It     was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express     was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I     fancy,  that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,     after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;     but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have     settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it     deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield,instead     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely     against the grain;I really believe your letter this morning     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that     would rob him of his borrowed feathers,give the praise where     it was due.   this must go no further than yourself, or     Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done     for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_,his     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his     reservewant of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character     had been so misunderstood,consequently that he had been     receivednoticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_     reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this     fine talking, my dear  you may rest perfectly assured that     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more     when the wedding took place,all money matters were then to     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to     us,Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was     exactly what he had been when I k him in Hertfordshire; but I     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour     while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a     piece with it,therefore what I now tell you can give you no     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,     representing to her the wickedness of what she had done,all     the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it     was by good luck, for . I was sometimes     quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear ElizabethJane,    for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual     in his return, and, as Lydia imformed you, attended the wedding. He     dined with us the next day,was to leave town again on     Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear      if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold     enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has,     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.     His understandingopinions all please me; he wants nothing but     a little more liveliness,_that_, if he marry _prudently_, his     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever     mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so     far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I     have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair     of ponies would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The     children have been wanting me this half hour.“ very sincerely,“”The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore thegreatest share. The vagueunsettled suspicions which uncertainty hadproduced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward hersister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion ofgoodness too great to be probable,at the same time dreaded to bejust, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatestextent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had takenon himself all the troublemortification attendant on such aresearch; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom hemust abominatedespise,where he was reduced to meet, frequentlymeet, reason with, persuade,finally bribe the man whom he alwaysmost wished to avoid,whose very name it was punishment to him topronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regardnor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But itwas a hope shortly checked by other considerations;she soon feltthat even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on hisaffection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able toovercome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship withWickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt fromthe connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to thinkhow much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked noextraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feelhe had been wrong; he had liberality,he had the means of exercisingit;though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her mightassist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must bematerially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know thatthey were under obligations to a person who could never receive areturn. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything tohim.  how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation shehad ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towardshim! For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud thatin a cause of compassionhonour he had been able to get the betterof himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again andagain. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensibleof some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastlyboth sheher uncle had been persuaded that affectionconfidencesubsisted between Mr. Darcyherself.She was roused from her seather reflections, by someone’s approach;and, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken byWickham.“” said he,as he joined her.“” she replied with a smile; “but it does not followthat the interruption must be unwelcome.”“I should be sorry, indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good friends,and now we are better.”“”“I do not know. Mrs. BennetLydia are going in the carriage toMeryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncleaunt, thatyou have actually seen Pemberley.”She replied in the affirmative.“I almost envy you the pleasure,yet I believe it would be too muchfor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw theold housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond ofme. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”“ she did.”“”“That you were gone into the army,she was afraid had--not turnedout well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangelymisrepresented.”“”biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she hadsilenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each otherseveral times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”“” saidElizabeth. “It must be something particular to take him there at thistime of year.”“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought Iunderstood from the Gardiners that you had.”“”“”“”“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this yearor two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very gladyou liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”“”“”“”“I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had. A mostdelightful place! Excellent parsonage-house! It would have suited me inevery respect.”“”“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, andthe exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine; but,to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, theretirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas ofhappiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention thecircumstance when you were in Kent?”“I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it wasleft you conditionally only,at the will of the present patron.”“You have!  there was something in _that_; I told you so from thefirst, you may remember.”“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not sopalatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actuallydeclared your resolution of never taking orders,that the businesshad been compromised accordingly.”“You did!it was not wholly without foundation. You may rememberwhat I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fastto get rid of him;unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,--“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brothersister, you know. Do not let usquarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of onemind.”She held out her hand: he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, thoughhe hardly k how to look,they entered the house.[Illustration:“.”]CHAPTER LIII.[Illustration]Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that henever again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,by introducing the subject of it;she was pleased to find that shehad said enough to keep him quiet.The day of hisLydia’s departure soon came;Mrs. Bennet wasforced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no meansentered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely tocontinue at least a twelvemonth.“ my dear Lydia,”“”“ Lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”“”“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time forwriting. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else todo.”Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. Hesmiled, looked handsome,said many pretty things.“” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out ofthe house, “as ever I saw. He simpers,smirks,makes love to usall. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucashimself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.“”“that there is nothing so bad as parting withone’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”“” saidElizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four aresingle.”“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. Ifthat had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortlyrelieved,her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by anarticle of s which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeperat Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of hermaster, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for severalweeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, andsmiled,shook her head, by turns.“ well,so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.Philips first brought her the s). “ so much the better. Not thatI care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know,I am sure Inever want to see him again.  however, he is very welcome to come toNetherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But thatis nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mentiona word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?”“” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was inMeryton last night: I saw her passing by,went out myself on purposeto know the truth of it;she told me that it was certainly true. Hecomes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She wasgoing to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat onWednesday,she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changingcolour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name toElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--“I saw you look at me to-day,  when my aunt told us of the presentreport;I know I appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was fromany silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt thatI _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the s does not affectme either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comesalone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him inDerbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with noother view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partialto Jane,she wavered as to the greater probability of his comingthere _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to comewithout it.“” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot cometo a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all thisspeculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”In spite of what her sister declared,really believed to be herfeelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easilyperceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,more unequal, than she had often seen them.The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.“”“youwill wait on him, of course.”“ no. You forced me into visiting him last year,promised, if Iwent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended innothing,I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attentionwould be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning toNetherfield.“” said he. “If he wants our society, lethim seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours inrunning after my neighbours every time they go awaycome backagain.”“ all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not waiton him.  however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, Iam determined. We must have Mrs. Longthe Gouldings soon. That willmake thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table forhim.”Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear herhusband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that herneighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--“” said Jane to her sister. “Itwould be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I canhardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what shesays. Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over!”“”“but itis wholly out of my power. You must feel it;the usual satisfactionof preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you havealways so much.”Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxietyand fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the daysthat must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless ofseeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival inHertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter thepaddock,ride towards the house.Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutelykept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, wentto the window--she looked--she saw ,sat downagain by her sister.“” said Kitty; “”“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do notknow.”“” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be withhim before. Mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”“ --and so it does, I vow.  any friend ofMr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I mustsay that I hate the very sight of him.”Jane looked at Elizabeth with surpriseconcern. She k but littleof their meeting in Derbyshire,therefore felt for the awkwardnesswhich must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first timeafter receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortableenough. Each felt for the other,of course for themselves;theirmother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy,her resolution to becivil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by eitherof them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet besuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towardshim. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensiveinformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebtedfor the first of benefits,whom she regarded herself with aninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonablejust, aswhat Jane felt for  Her astonishment at his coming--at hiscoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn,voluntarily seeking her again,was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his alteredbehaviour in Derbyshire.The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half aminute with an additional glow,a smile of delight added lustre toher eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection andwishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.“” said she; “it will then be earlyenough for expectation.”She sat intently at work, striving to be composed,without daring tolift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of hersister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a littlepaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On thegentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them withtolerable ease,with a propriety of behaviour equally free from anysymptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow,sat downagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. Shehad ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and,she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than asshe had seen him at Pemberley.  perhaps, he could not in hermother’s presence be what he was before her uncleaunt. It was apainful, but not an improbable, conjecture.Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant,in that short periodsaw him looking both pleasedembarrassed. He was received by Mrs.Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,especially when contrasted with the coldceremonious politeness ofher courtesyaddress of his friend.Elizabeth particularly, who k that her mother owed to the latter thepreservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, washurtdistressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so illapplied.Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr.Mrs. Gardiner did--a questionwhich she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. Hewas not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; butit had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friendswhen he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, withoutbringing the sound of his voice;when occasionally, unable to resistthe impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as oftenfound him looking at Jane as at herself,frequently on no object butthe ground. More thoughtfulnessless anxiety to please, than whenthey last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed,angrywith herself for being so.“”“”She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself;tohim she had hardly courage to speak.She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.“” said Mrs. Bennet.He readily agreed to it.“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hopeit is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhoodsince you went away. Miss Lucas is marriedsettled:one of myown daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must haveseen it in the papers. It was in the ‘Times’the ‘Courier,’ I know;though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,George Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being asyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too,I wonder how he cameto make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”Bingley replied that he did,made his congratulations. Elizabethdared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she couldnot tell.“”continued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is veryhard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, aplace quite northward it seems,there they are to stay, I do notknow how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard ofhis leaving the ----shire,of his being gone into the Regulars.Thank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as hedeserves.”Elizabeth, who k this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such miseryof shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually donebefore;she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in thecountry at present. A few weeks, he believed.“” said her mother,“I beg you will come hereshoot as many as you please on Mr.Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, andwill save all the best of the coveys for you.”Elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officiousattention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as hadflattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would behastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends formoments of such painful confusion.“” said she to herself, “is never more to bein company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasurethat will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see eitherone or the other again!”Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer nocompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observinghow much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her formerlover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but everyfive minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found heras handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured,asunaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that nodifference should be perceived in her at all,was really persuadedthat she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,that she did not always know when she was silent.When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of herintended civility,they were invitedengaged to dine atLongbourn in a few days’ time.“” she added; “for whenyou went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner withus as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see;I assure youI was very much disappointed that you did not come backkeep yourengagement.”Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection,said something ofhis concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to staydinethere that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she didnot think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a manon whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetiteprideof one who had ten thousand a year.[Illustration:     “”]CHAPTER LIV.[Illustration]As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjectswhich must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonishedvexedher.“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave,indifferent,” said she,“”She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.“He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncleaunt, when hewas in town;why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If heno longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will thinkno more about him.”Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approachof her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed herbetter satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.“”“that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectlyeasy. I know my own strength,I shall never be embarrassed again byhis coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publiclyseen, that on both sides we meet only as commonindifferentacquaintance.”“ very indifferent, indeed,”laughingly. “ Jane!take care.”“My dear  you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love withyou as ever.”They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday;Mrs. Bennet, inthe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which thegood-humourcommon politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,had revived.On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn;the twowho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality assportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to thedining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would takethe place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, byher sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore toinvite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed tohesitate; but ,happened to smile: it wasdecided. He placed himself by her.Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. Hebore it with noble indifference;she would have imagined thatBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyeslikewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughingalarm.His behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed anadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuadedElizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness,hisown, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon theconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. Itgave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was inno cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the tablecould divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She k how littlesuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear toadvantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; butshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other,how formal andcold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousnessmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tellhim, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole ofthe family.She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity ofbringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass awaywithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious anduneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemencame, was wearisomedull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all herchance of pleasure for the evening must depend.“”“I shall give him up forever.”The gentlemen came;she thought he looked as if he would haveanswered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,where Miss Bennet was making tea,Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near herwhich would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one ofthe girls moved closer to her than ever,said, in a whisper,--“The men shan’t comepart us, I am determined. We want none of them;do we?”Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him withher eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enoughto help anybody to coffee,then was enraged against herself forbeing so silly!“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough toexpect a real of his love? Is there one among the sex who would notprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cuphimself;she seized the opportunity of saying,--“”“”“”“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarboroughthese three weeks.”She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to conversewith her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, forsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whisperingto Elizabeth again, he walked away.When the tea things were removed,the card tables placed, the ladiesall rose;Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, whenall her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to hermother’s rapacity for whist players,in a few moments after seatedwith the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.They were confined for the evening at different tables;she hadnothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her sideof the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen tosupper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of theothers,she had no opportunity of detaining them.“ girls,”as soon as they were left to themselves, “whatsay you to the day? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, Iassure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. Thevenison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fata haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at theLucases’ last week;even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridgeswere remarkably well done;I suppose he has two or three Frenchcooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greaterbeauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. Andwhat do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have herat Netherfield at last!’ She did, indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is asgood a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behavedgirls,not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”[Illustration:     “M^{rs}. Longher nieces.”]Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough ofBingley’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him atlast;her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happyhumour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed atnot seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.“” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “Theparty seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope wemay often meet again.”Elizabeth smiled.“ you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. Iassure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as anagreeablesensible young man without having a wish beyond it. I amperfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never hadany design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed withgreater sweetness of address,a stronger desire of generallypleasing, than any other man.”“” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, andare provoking me to it every moment.”“How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible inothers! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than Iacknowledge?”“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love toinstruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgiveme;if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ yourconfidante.”[Illustration:     “.”]CHAPTER LV.[Illustration]A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again,alone. Hisfriend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home inten days’ time. He sat with them above an hour,was in remarkablygood spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with manyexpressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.“”“”He should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.;if shewould give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting onthem.“” he had no engagement at all for to-morrow;her invitation wasaccepted with alacrity.He came,in such very good time, that the ladies were none of themdressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters’ room, in herdressing-gown,with her hair half finished, crying out,--“My dear Jane, make hastehurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley iscome. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to MissBennet this moment,help her on with her gown. Never mind MissLizzy’s hair.”“” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty isforwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick!where is your sash, my dear?”But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go downwithout one of her sisters.The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in theevening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was hiscustom,Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of thefive being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat lookingwinking atElizabethCatherine for a considerable time, without making anyimpression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her;when at lastKitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What doyou keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”“” She then sat stillfive minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, shesuddenly got up,saying to Kitty,--“” took her out of the room.Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at suchpremeditation,her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In afew minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the doorcalled out,--“ my dear, I want to speak with you.”Elizabeth was forced to go.“” said her mother assoon as she was in the hall. “KittyI are going upstairs to sit inmy dressing-room.”Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remainedquietly in the hall till sheKitty were out of sight, then returnedinto the drawing-room.Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley waseverything that was  except the professed lover of herdaughter. His easecheerfulness rendered him a most agreeableaddition to their evening party;he bore with the ill-judgedofficiousness of the mother,heard all her silly remarks with aforbearancecommand of countenance particularly grateful to thedaughter.He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper;before he went awayan engagement was formed, chiefly through his ownMrs. Bennet’smeans, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passedbetween the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in thehappy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcyreturned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerablypersuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’sconcurrence.Bingley was punctual to his appointment;heMr. Bennet spent themorning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much moreagreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumptionor folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him intosilence;he was more communicative,less eccentric, than theother had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to geteverybody away from himher daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter towrite, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; foras the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not bewanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.But on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that hermother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, sheperceived her sisterBingley standing together over the hearth, asif engaged in earnest conversation;had this led to no suspicion,the faces of both, as they hastily turned roundmoved away from eachother, would have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but_hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered byeither;Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, whenBingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would givepleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliestemotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.“”“by far too much. I do not deserve it. why is not everybody as happy?”Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, adelight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence ofkindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would notallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to besaid, for the present.“”“I would not on anyaccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear itfrom anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already.   toknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dearfamily! how shall I bear so much happiness?”She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up thecard-party,was sitting upstairs with Kitty.Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidityeasewith which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so manyprevious months of suspensevexation.“”“is the end of all his friend’s anxiouscircumspection! of all his sister’s falsehoodcontrivance! thehappiest, wisest,most reasonable end!”In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with herfather had been shortto the purpose.“” said he hastily, as he opened the door.“”He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishesand affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestlyheartily expressed herdelight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands withgreat cordiality;then, till her sister came down, she had to listento all he had to say of his own happiness,of Jane’s perfections;and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all hisexpectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had forbasis the excellent understandingsuper-excellent disposition ofJane,a general similarity of feelingtaste between her andhimself.It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction ofMiss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, asmade her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simperedsmiled,hopedher turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, orspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour;whenMr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voicemanner plainly showedhow really happy he was.Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till theirvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, heturned to his daughtersaid,--“”Jane went to him instantly, kissed him,thanked him for hisgoodness.“”“and I have great pleasure inthinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of yourdoing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You areeach of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; soeasy, that every servant will cheat you;so generous, that you willalways exceed your income.”“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would beunpardonable in _me_.”“Exceed their income! ” cried his wife, “what are youtalking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year,very likelymore.” Then addressing her daughter, “ my dear, dear Jane, I am sohappy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I k how itwould be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could notbe so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, whenhe first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it wasthat you should come together.  he is the handsomest young man thatever was seen!”Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition herfavourite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her youngersisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happinesswhich she might in future be able to dispense.Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield;Kittybegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;coming frequently before breakfast,always remaining till aftersupper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enoughdetested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thoughthimself obliged to accept.Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; forwhile he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: butshe found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours ofseparation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he alwaysattached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; andwhen Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.“”one evening, “by telling me that hewas totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believedit possible.”“” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account forit?”“It must have been his sisters’ doing. They were certainly no friends tohis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might havechosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they willlearn to be contented,we shall be on good terms again: though wecan never be what we once were to each other.”“”“that I everheard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you againthe dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”“Would you believe it,  that when he went to town last November hereally loved me,nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferentwould have prevented his coming down again?”“He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of hismodesty.”This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, andthe little value he put on his own good qualities.Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interferenceof his friend; for, though Jane had the most generousforgivingheart in the world, she k it was a circumstance which must prejudiceher against him.“” criedJane. “  why am I thus singled from my family,blessedabove them all? If I could but see you as happy! If there were but suchanother man for you!”“If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have yourhappiness.  no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have verygood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long asecret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, andshe ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all herneighbours in Meryton.The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in theworld; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.[Illustration]CHAPTER LVI.[Illustration]One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had beenformed, as hethe females of the family were sitting together in thedining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by thesound of a carriage;they perceived a chaisefour driving up thelawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors;besides, theequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horseswere post;neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant whopreceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, thatsomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoidthe confinement of such an intrusion,walk away with him into theshrubbery. They both set off;the conjectures of the remaining threecontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrownopen,their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.They were of course all intending to be surprised: but theirastonishment was beyond their expectation;on the part of Mrs.BennetKitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, eveninferior to what Elizabeth felt.She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made noother reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of thehead,sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned hername to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request ofintroduction had been made.Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of suchhigh importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sittingfor a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is yourmother?”Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.“”“ madam,”delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”“” returned  after ashort silence.“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, Iassure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”“This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening insummer: the windows are full west.”Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner;thenadded,--“May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. andMrs. Collins well?”“ very well. I saw them the night before last.”Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her fromCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But noletter appeared,she was completely puzzled.Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her Ladyship to take somerefreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely,not very politely,declined eating anything;then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,--“ there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wildernesson one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if youwill favour me with your company.”“” cried her mother, “and show her Ladyship about thedifferent walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”Elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour anddrawing-room,pronouncing them, after a short survey, to bedecent-looking rooms, walked on.Her carriage remained at the door,Elizabeth saw that herwaiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walkthat led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort forconversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent anddisagreeable.[Illustration:“”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“”as she looked inher face.As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the followingmanner:--“You can be at no loss,  to understand the reason of myjourney hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why Icome.”Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.“ you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to accountfor the honour of seeing you here.”“” replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought toknow that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ maychoose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever beencelebrated for its sincerityfrankness;in a cause of suchmoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a mostalarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only yoursister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that_you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soonafterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure himso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved onsetting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known toyou.”“”colouringwith astonishmentdisdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of comingso far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?”“”“Your coming to Longbourn, to see memy family,” said Elizabethcoolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a reportis in existence.”“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not beenindustriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such areport is spread abroad?”“”“”“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. _You_may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.”“This is not to be borne.  I insist on being satisfied. Hashe, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”“”“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of hisreason. But _your_ artsallurements may, in a moment of infatuation,have made him forget what he owes to himselfto all his family. Youmay have drawn him in.”“”“ do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to suchlanguage as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”“But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour asthis ever induce me to be explicit.”“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have thepresumption to aspire, can never take place.  never. Mr. Darcy isengaged to _my daughter_.  what have you to say?”“Only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he willmake an offer to me.”Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment,then replied,--“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned theunion;now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would beaccomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman ofinferior birth, of no importance in the world,wholly unallied tothe family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to histacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling ofproprietydelicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from hisearliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”“Yes;I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is noother objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not bekept from it by knowing that his motheraunt wished him to marryMiss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning themarriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither byhonour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to makeanother choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”“Because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it.  MissBennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family orfriends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You willbe censured, slighted,despised, by everyone connected with him.Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentionedby any of us.”“” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarilyattached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no causeto repine.”“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitudefor my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on thatscore? Let us sit down. You are to understand,  that I camehere with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will Ibe dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’swhims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”“_That_ will make your Ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;but it will have no effect on _me_.”“I will not be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughtermynephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternalside, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,honourable,ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune onboth sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice ofevery member of their respective houses;what is to dividethem?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,connections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But it must not, shallnot be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish toquit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting thatsphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we areequal.”“True. You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But what was your mother? Whoare your unclesaunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of theircondition.”“”“if your nephew doesnot object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”“”Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging LadyCatherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after amoment’s deliberation,--“”Lady Catherine seemed pleased.“”“”“ I am shockedastonished. I expected to find a morereasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that Iwill ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me theassurance I require.”“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated intoanything so wholly unreasonable. Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marryyour daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached tome, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it onhis cousin? Allow me to say,  that the arguments withwhich you have supported this extraordinary application have been asfrivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken mycharacter, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself inmine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on thesubject.”“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all theobjections I have already urged I have still another to add. I am nostranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamouselopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was apatched-up business, at the expense of your fatheruncle. And is_such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her_ husband, who is the sonof his late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heavenearth!--ofwhat are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”“” she resentfully answered.“You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return tothe house.”And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also,they turnedback. Her Ladyship was highly incensed.“You have no regard, then, for the honourcredit of my nephew!Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with youmust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”“ I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”“”“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, withoutreference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey theclaims of duty, honour,gratitude. You are determined to ruin him inthe opinion of all his friends,make him the contempt of the world.”“” replied Elizabeth, “has anypossible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of eitherwould be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to theresentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’sconcern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join inthe scorn.”“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. Ishall now know how to act. Do not imagine,  that yourambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find youreasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.”In this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door ofthe carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--“I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to yourmother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”Elizabeth made no answer;without attempting to persuade herLadyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. Sheheard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. Her motherimpatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why LadyCatherine would not come in againrest herself.“” said her daughter; “”“She is a very fine-looking woman!her calling here was prodigiouslycivil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.She is on her road somewhere, I dare say;so, passing throughMeryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she hadnothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”Elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for toacknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.[Illustration:     “”]CHAPTER LVII.[Illustration]The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threwElizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for manyhours learn to think of it less than incessantly.  itappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosingsfor the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report oftheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when theexpectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supplythe idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of hersister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours atLucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with theCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached ) hadonly set _that_ down as almost certainimmediate which _she_ hadlooked forward to as possible at some future time.In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not helpfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persistingin this interference. From what she had said of her resolution toprevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate anapplication to her nephew;how he might take a similarrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her she darednot pronounce. She k not the exact degree of his affection for hisaunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to supposethat he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do;itwas certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt wouldaddress him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he wouldprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weakand ridiculous, contained much good sensesolid reasoning.If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had oftenseemed likely, the adviceentreaty of so near a relation mightsettle every doubt,determine him at once to be as happy as dignityunblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. LadyCatherine might see him in her way through town;his engagement toBingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to hisfriend within a few days,”“I shall know how to understandit. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of hisconstancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he mighthave obtained my affectionshand, I shall soon cease to regret himat all.”The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor hadbeen, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the samekind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; andElizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by herfather, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.“”“”She followed him thither;her curiosity to know what he had to tellher was heightened by the supposition of its being in some mannerconnected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it mightbe from she anticipated with dismay all theconsequent explanations.She followed her father to the fireplace,they both sat down. Hethen said,--“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished meexceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know itscontents. I did not know before that I had _two_ daughters on the brinkof matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneousconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explainedhimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed toherself, when her father continued,--“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such mattersas these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover thename of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”“From Mr. Collins!what can _he_ have to say?”“Something very much to the purpose, of course. He begins withcongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, ofwhich, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossipingLucases. I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he sayson that point. What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thusoffered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collinsmyself onthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughterElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, afterher eldest sister has resigned it;the chosen partner of her fatemay be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personagesin this land.’ Can you possibly guess,  who is meant by this?‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything theheart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, andextensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warnmy cousin Elizabeth,yourself, of what evils you may incur by aprecipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea, who this gentleman is? . ‘My motive forcautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt,Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendlyeye.’ _Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man!   I think I _have_surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, withinthe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie moreeffectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at anywoman but to see a blemish,who probably never looked at _you_ inhis life! It is admirable!”Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only forceone most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner solittle agreeable to her.“”“ yes. Pray read on.”“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship lastnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what shefelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score ofsome family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never giveher consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it myduty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that sheand her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about,not runhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.Collins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sadbusiness has been so well hushed up,am only concerned that theirliving together before the marriage took place should be so generallyknown. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrainfrom declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the youngcouple into your house as soon as they were married. It was anencouragement of vice;had I been the rector of Longbourn, I shouldvery strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them asa Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow theirnames to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _That_ is his notion ofChristian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dearCharlotte’s situation,his expectation of a young olive-branch.  you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be_missish_, pretend to be affronted at an idle report. Forwhat do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours,laugh at themin our turn?”“”“I am exceedingly diverted. But it is sostrange!”“ _that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other manit would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference_your_pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominatewriting, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for anyconsideration.  when I read a letter of his, I cannot help givinghim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence andhypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray,  what said Lady Catherineabout this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh;as it hadbeen asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by hisrepeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make herfeelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh when shewould rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her bywhat he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference;she could do nothing butwonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead ofhis seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.[Illustration:“”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER LVIII.[Illustration]Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, asElizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcywith him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’svisit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time totell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat inmomentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposedtheir all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in thehabit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining fiveset off together. BingleyJane, however, soon allowed the others tooutstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty,Darcywere to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty wastoo much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming adesperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.They walked towards the Lucases’, because Kitty wished to call uponMaria;as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was themoment for her resolution to be executed;while her courage washigh, she immediately said,--“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature,for the sake of givingrelief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours. Ican no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poorsister. Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious toacknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the restof my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”“” replied Darcy, in a tone of surpriseand emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in amistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardinerwas so little to be trusted.”“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed tome that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I couldnot rest till I k the particulars. Let me thank you againagain,in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which inducedyou to take so much trouble,bear so many mortifications, for thesake of discovering them.”“”“let it be for yourself alone.That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the otherinducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thoughtonly of _you_.”Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If yourfeelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_affectionswishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silenceme on this subject for ever.”Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardnessanxiety ofhis situation, now forced herself to speak;immediately, though notvery fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergoneso material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to makeher receive with gratitudepleasure his present assurances. Thehappiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably neverfelt before;he expressed himself on the occasion as sensiblyaswarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabethbeen able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well theexpression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: butthough she could not look she could listen;he told her of feelingswhich, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affectionevery moment more valuable.They walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much tobe thought,felt,said, for attention to any other objects. Shesoon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understandingto the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return throughLondon,there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive,thesubstance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically onevery expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship’s apprehension,peculiarly denoted her perversenessassurance, in the belief thatsuch a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise fromher nephew which _she_ had refused to give.  unluckily for herLadyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.“”“as I had scarcely ever allowed myselfto hope before. I k enough of your disposition to be certain, thathad you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would haveacknowledged it to Lady Catherine franklyopenly.”Elizabeth colouredlaughed as“ you know enough ofmy _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you soabominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to allyour relations.”“What did you say of me that I did not deserve? For though youraccusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviourto you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It wasunpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to thatevening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictlyexamined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, improved in civility.”“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what Ithen said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole ofit, is now,has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Yourreproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had you behaved in amore gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you canscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, Iconfess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong animpression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in sucha way.”“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every properfeeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall neverforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possibleway that would induce you to accept me.”“ do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do atall. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”Darcy mentioned his letter. “” said he,--“did it _soon_ make youthink better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to itscontents?”She explained what its effects on her had been,how gradually allher former prejudices had been removed.“I k,”“that what I wrote must give you pain, but it wasnecessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part,especially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the powerof reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justlymake you hate me.”“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to thepreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think myopinions not entirely unalterable, they are not,  quite so easilychanged as that implies.”“” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectlycalmcool; but I am since convinced that it was written in adreadful bitterness of spirit.”“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. Theadieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelingsof the person who wrotethe person who received it are now so widelydifferent from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstanceattending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of myphilosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives youpleasure.”“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentmentarising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, ofignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections willintrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been aselfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As achild I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct mytemper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in prideand conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_),I was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my fatherparticularly, all that was benevolentamiable,) allowed, encouraged,almost taught me to be selfishoverbearing, to care for none beyondmy own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to_wish_ at least to think meanly of their senseworth compared withmy own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty;such I mightstill have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I notowe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but mostadvantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without adoubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all mypretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”“”“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to bewishing, expecting my addresses.”“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assureyou. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead mewrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening!”“Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began totake a proper direction.”“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met atPemberley. You blamed me for coming?”“ indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness,Iconfess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”“” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civilityin my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past;I hopedto obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting yousee that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishesintroduced themselves, I can hardly tell, but I believe in about halfan hour after I had seen you.”He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance,of herdisappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading tothe cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution offollowing her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formedbefore he quitted the inn,that his gravitythoughtfulness therehad arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose mustcomprehend.She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject toeach to be dwelt on farther.After walking several miles in a leisurely manner,too busy to knowanything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, thatit was time to be at home.“What could have become of Mr. BingleyJane?” was a wonder whichintroduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted withtheir engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information ofit.“” said Elizabeth.“”“” Andthough he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty muchthe case.“”“I made aconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I toldhim of all that had occurred to make my former interference in hisaffairs absurdimpertinent. His surprise was great. He had never hadthe slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myselfmistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferentto him;as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her wasunabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing hisfriend.“”“when you told himthat my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”“From the former. I had ly observed her, during the two visitswhich I had lately made her here;I was convinced of her affection.”“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction tohim.”“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence hadprevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, buthis reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess onething, which for a time,not unjustly, offended him. I could notallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three monthslast winter, that I had known it,purposely kept it from him. He wasangry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remainedin any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven menow.”Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightfulfriend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checkedherself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, andit was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness ofBingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, hecontinued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall theyparted.[Illustration:     “”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER LIX.[Illustration]“My dear  where can you have been walking to?” was a questionwhich Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, andfrom all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say inreply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her ownknowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anythingelse, awakened a suspicion of the truth.The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. Theacknowledged lovers talkedlaughed; the unacknowledged were silent.Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;and Elizabeth, agitatedconfused, rather _k_ that she was happythan _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt inthe family when her situation became known: she was aware that no oneliked him but Jane;even feared that with the others it was a_dislike_ which not all his fortuneconsequence might do away.At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very farfrom Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to   no,you shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.”“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you;and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, Iam in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me,weare engaged.”Jane looked at her doubtingly. “ Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how muchyou dislike him.”“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps Idid not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as thesea good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall everremember it myself.”Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again,moreseriously, assured her of its truth.“” criedJane. “My dear, dear  I would, I do congratulate you; but are youcertain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can behappy with him?”“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that weare to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane?Shall you like to have such a brother?”“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself moredelight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do youreally love him quite well enough?  Lizzy! do anything rather thanmarry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you oughtto do?”“ yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do when Itell you all.”“”“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do  I amafraid you will be angry.”“My dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously.Let me know everything that I am to know without delay. Will you tell mehow long you have loved him?”“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful groundsat Pemberley.”Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced thedesired effect;she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances ofattachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothingfurther to wish.“”“for you will be as happy as myself. Ialways had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, Imust always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friendyourhusband, there can be only Bingleyyourself more dear to me.  you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did youtell me of what passed at PemberleyLambton! I owe all that I knowof it to another, not to you.”Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling tomention Bingley;the unsettled state of her own feelings had madeher equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longerconceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,and half the night spent in conversation.“” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the nextmorning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again withour dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be alwayscoming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something orother,not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’sway.”Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yetwas really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such anepithet.As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, andshook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more laneshereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”“I advise Mr. Darcy,Kitty,”“to walkto Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk,Mr. Darcy hasnever seen the view.”“” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I amsure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?”Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a greatcuriosity to see the view from the Mount,Elizabeth silentlyconsented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,saying,--“I am quite sorry,  that you should be forced to have thatdisagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It isall for Jane’s sake, you know;there is no occasion for talking tohim except just nowthen; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should beasked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself theapplication for her mother’s. She could not determine how her motherwould take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealthgrandeurwould be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether shewere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, itwas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit toher sense;she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear thefirst raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of herdisapprobation.In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she sawMr. Darcy rise alsofollow him,her agitation on seeing it wasextreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going tobe made unhappy,that it should be through her means; that _she_,his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should befilling him with fearsregrets in disposing of her, was a wretchedreflection,she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minuteshe approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, whilepretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; hewants you in the library.” She was gone directly.Her father was walking about the room, looking graveanxious.“”“what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to beaccepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been morereasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her fromexplanationsprofessions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;but they were now necessary,she assured him, with some confusion,of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to besure,you may have more fine clothesfine carriages than Jane.But will they make you happy?”“”“than your belief of myindifference?”“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; butthis would be nothing if you really liked him.”“”with tears in her eyes; “I love him.Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do notknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him insuch terms.”“” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kindof man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which hecondescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved onhaving him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know yourdisposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy norrespectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you lookedup to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in thegreatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escapediscreditmisery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you areabout.”Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnestsolemn in her reply;and, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really theobject of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which herestimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty thathis affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of manymonths’ suspense,enumerating with energy all his good qualities,she did conquer her father’s incredulity,reconcile him to thematch.“ my dear,”when she ceased speaking, “I have no more tosay. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted withyou, my  to anyone less worthy.”To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcyhad voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts,got himhis commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of troubleand economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must_would_ havepaid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their ownway. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rantstorm abouthis love for you,there will be an end of the matter.”He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his readingMr. Collins’s letter;after laughing at her some time, allowed herat last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men comefor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, afterhalf an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to jointhe others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent forgaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longeranything material to be dreaded,the comfort of easefamiliaritywould come in time.When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;for, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still,unable toutter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she couldcomprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit whatwas for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of alover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about inher chair, get up, sit down again, wonder,bless herself.“ Lord bless me! only think! dear me!  Who wouldhave thought it? And is it really true?  my sweetest Lizzy! how richand how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriagesyou will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am sopleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall!  mydear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. Ihope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everythingthat is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Lord! what will become of me? I shall go distracted.”This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; andElizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,her mother followed her.“”“I can think of nothing else. Tenthousand a year,very likely more! ’Tis as good as a lord! And aspecial licence--you mustshall be married by a special licence. my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fondof, that I may have it to-morrow.”This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentlemanhimself might be;Elizabeth found that, though in the certainpossession of his warmest affection,secure of her relations’consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrowpassed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stoodin such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speakto him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or markher deference for his opinion.Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to getacquainted with him;Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was risingevery hour in his esteem.“” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as wellas Jane’s.”[Illustration:“.”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER LX.[Illustration]Elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How couldyou begin?”“I can comprehend your going on charmingly, whenyou had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the firstplace?”“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, whichlaid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before Ik that I _had_ begun.”“My beauty you had early withstood,as for my manners--my behaviourto _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil,I never spoketo you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.  besincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”“”“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officiousattention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,and looking,thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused andinterested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been reallyamiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains youtook to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noblejust; andin your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduouslycourted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectlyreasonable. To be sure you know no actual good of me--but nobody thinksof _that_ when they fall in love.”“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she wasill at Netherfield?”“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of itby all means. My good qualities are under your protection,you areto exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to meto find occasions for teasingquarrelling with you as often as maybe;I shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwillingto come to the point at last? What made you so shy of me, when youfirst called,afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when youcalled, did you look as if you did not care about me?”“Because you were gravesilent,gave me no encouragement.”“”“”“”“”“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,thatI should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder whenyou _would_ have spoken if I had not asked you! My resolution ofthanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Toomuch_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfortsprings from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned thesubject? This will never do.”“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. LadyCatherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means ofremoving all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness toyour eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour towait for an opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope,and I was determined at once to know everything.”“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down toNetherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbournbe embarrassed?or had you intended any more serious consequences?”“My real purpose was to see _you_,to judge, if I could, whether Imight ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed tomyself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley, andif she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is tobefall her?”“I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought tobe done;if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be donedirectly.”“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, andadmire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. ButI have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcyhad been overrated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’slong letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she k wouldbe most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncleaunthad already lost three days of happiness,immediately wrote asfollows:--“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,for your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say thetruth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy,indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject willafford,unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatlyerr. You must write again very soon,praise him a great deal morethan you did in your last. I thank you againagain, for not going tothe Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of theponies is delightful. We will go round the park every day. I am thehappiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said sobefore, but no one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; sheonly smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world thatcan be spared from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.” etc.Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style,stilldifferent from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in returnfor his last.     /* “Dear Sir, */     “I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will     soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as     you can.  if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has     more to give.“” etc.Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approachingmarriage were all that was affectionateinsincere. She wrote even toJane on the occasion, to express her delight,repeat all her formerprofessions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; andthough feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a muchkinder answer than she k was deserved.The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information wasas sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper wereinsufficient to contain all her delight,all her earnest desire ofbeing loved by her sister.Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulationsto Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that theCollinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of thissudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered soexceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, thatCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away tillthe storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friendwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of theirmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when shesaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the paradingobsequious civility of herhusband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could evenlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying awaythe brightest jewel of the country,expressed his hopes of their allmeeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he didshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.Mrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on hisforbearance;though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood intoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’sgood-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must bevulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, atall likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could toshield him from the frequent notice of either,was ever anxious tokeep him to herself,to those of her family with whom he mightconverse without mortification;though the uncomfortable feelingsarising from all this took from the season of courtship much of itspleasure, it added to the hope of the future;she looked forwardwith delight to the time when they should be removed from society solittle pleasing to either, to all the comfortelegance of theirfamily party at Pemberley.[Illustration]CHAPTER LXI.[Illustration]Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet gotrid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride sheafterwards visited Mrs. Bingley,talked of Mrs. Darcy, may beguessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that theaccomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many ofher children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps,it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domesticfelicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervousand invariably silly.Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for herdrew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted ingoing to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.Mr. BingleyJane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So neara vicinity to her motherMeryton relations was not desirable even to_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of hissisters was then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring countyto Derbyshire;JaneElizabeth, in addition to every other sourceof happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time withher two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generallyknown, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable atemper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example, shebecame, by proper attentionmanagement, less irritable, lessignorant,less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’ssociety she was of course carefully kept;though Mrs. Wickhamfrequently invited her to comestay with her, with the promise ofballsyoung men, her father would never consent to her going.Mary was the only daughter who remained at home;she was necessarilydrawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quiteunable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, butshe could still moralize over every morning visit;as she was nolonger mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beautyher own,it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change withoutmuch reluctance.As for WickhamLydia, their characters suffered no revolution fromthe marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction thatElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitudeand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite ofeverything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet beprevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter whichElizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, byhis wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. Theletter was to this effect:--     /* “My dear  */     “I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear     Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you     so rich;when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will     think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very     much;I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live     upon without some help. Any place would do of about three or four     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,     if you had rather not.“” etc.As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured inher answer to put an end to every entreatyexpectation of the kind.Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practiceof what might be called economy in her own private expenses, shefrequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such anincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant intheir wants,heedless of the future, must be very insufficient totheir support;whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane orherself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towardsdischarging their bills. Their manner of living, even when therestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in theextreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of acheap situation,always spending more than they ought. His affectionfor her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,in spite of her youthher manners, she retained all the claims toreputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could neverreceive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted himfurther in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, whenher husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath;with theBingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that evenBingley’s good-humour was overcome,he proceeded so far as to _talk_of giving them a hint to be gone.Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as shethought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, shedropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost asattentive to Darcy as heretofore,paid off every arrear of civilityto Elizabeth.Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home;the attachment of the sisterswas exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love eachother, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinionin the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with anastonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner oftalking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respectwhich almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of openpleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen inher way. By Elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that awoman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will notalways allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, inher reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent himlanguage so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some timeall intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,he was prevailed on to overlook the offence,seek a reconciliation;and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, herresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosityto see how his wife conducted herself;she condescended to wait onthem at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods hadreceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but thevisits of her uncleaunt from the city.With the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy,as well as Elizabeth, really loved them;they were both eversensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringingher into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.
